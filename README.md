# Bilingualism_Visualization

After interviewing bilingual people for an intro to linguistics course, I decided to see what the possibilities would be 
to try to find patterns in the data and visualize it. I decided to try to compare the word usage of non-native English speakers 
and native English speakers when talking about their bilingualism. The results were very interesting. They can be seen in the 
results folder. The code for the word usage is in the testing folder. Another program in Positive:Negative analysizes the frequency of positive and negative words in the various interviews.

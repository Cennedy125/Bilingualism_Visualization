# Bilingualism_Visualization

After interviewing bilingual people for an intro to linguistics course, I decided to see what the possibilities would be 
to try to find patterns in the data and visualize it. I decided to try to compare the word usage of non-native English speakers 
and native English speakers when talking about their bilingualism. The results were very interesting. They can be seen in the 
results folder.

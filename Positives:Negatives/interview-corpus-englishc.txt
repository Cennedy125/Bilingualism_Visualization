Helena Crusius Professor Brook Lillihuagen Introduction to Linguistics November 16th, 2017 Foreign Language as an Away Game Don Juan (1) is a 19-year-old (2) student living in New York who was born and raised in San Jose, California (3). She speaks three languages: English, Spanish, and Mandarin (4). She was raised speaking English, learned Spanish starting at the age of 11 and just started learning Mandarin at the age of 18 (5). She feels most fluent in English, decently fluent in Spanish and very novice at Mandarin (6) and she considers English her dominant language (7). She uses English for almost all her communication, Spanish only briefly when interacting with Spanishspeaking people since she has stopped pursuing it in the classroom, and Mandarin exclusively in academic contexts (8). She spoke English in her home as a child, despite having Mandarin-speaking family members (9). When asked if she would like a fun nomme de plume for this interview, my interviewee responded “yes.” I’ve elected Don Juan after the rapscallion protagonist in a play we read in Spanish V AP senior year of high school. One of the reasons I approached Don about this interview was this shared bilingual history- for three out of four Spanish classes I took, she was in them too, though our other languages are surprisingly disparate. We’ve had conversations about the new languages we’re learning in our first year of college (she’s learning Mandarin, I’m learning Latin), so I thought it would be apropos to find out more about her linguistic history and motivations. Don is an 18-year-old (2) student currently living in New York City who was born and grew up in San Jose, California, (3) where we both went to school. Although her father is Burmese (29), she only spoke English in her home growing up (5). As is the case in many California middle schools, Don was taught Spanish starting at the age of 11 and continued to 18 (5). This year, she chose to take an introductory Mandarin course at her school (5) both because of how she considers it a “global language” and because her grandmother speaks Mandarin and she wants to get more in touch with her heritage. She considers English her dominant language (7) and the only language of her three that 2 she is fully fluent in. Don describes herself as “intermittently fluent” in Spanish (sometimes she can follow a native speaker’s conversation and sometimes she can’t remember basic vocabulary) and “not yet fluent” in Mandarin (6). Despite English, Spanish and Mandarin being culturally disparate languages, she says that she finds herself in contact with them in different ways every day. She speaks and interacts with people mainly in English, does her Mandarin homework in Mandarin, and overhears her roommate speaking Spanish to relatives back home. She also encounters Mandarin while living and moving around in New York, catching snippets of conversation between families or friends that she can understand bits and pieces of (8). Learning Mandarin was more of an independent choice than learning Spanish for Don. While Spanish was the required language at her middle school and one of two she could choose from in high school (10), Mandarin was one of many different languages available to take at an undergraduate level. Although many people (including myself) warned her of the difficulty of Mandarin and the complexity of the script, she was genuinely interested in pursuing it. A big part of choosing Mandarin was how it connected to her heritage- her grandma often addresses her in Mandarin, but Don doesn’t understand enough to keep an entire conversation (10). Although she is learning Mandarin to better be able to communicate with her family, her physical distance from them keeps the use of Mandarin strictly within an academic context, unwittingly a parallel to her experience learning Spanish (10). When asked about how learning Mandarin is different than learning Spanish, Don points out the obvious difference in alphabet, but also tells me that Mandarin is an iconographic language. She shows me character for rice field, commenting that it’s made of the symbols for plant and field, but that the rice component is something you can only know through instruction. This felt like how even onomatopoeic words in English transcribing real sound require instruction to know/understand. Additionally, despite the perceived distance between Mandarin and Spanish, she often reaches for Spanish words when in the Mandarin classroom (17). However, because she is learning Mandarin for herself and not for a requirement, these difficulties do not deter her- “even if I don’t always do all the homework, I’m still fully committed” (10). Still, she thinks immersion and real conversation would help Mandarin to become as visceral to her as English (and, to a lesser extent, Spanish) (14). 3 Don says that she overwhelmingly thinks in English, but that when her roommate is on the phone and speaking in Spanish, she finds herself thinking in Spanish as well (14). Similarly, she mostly dreams in English, but sometimes does dream in Spanish (15). When she knows the person she’s speaking to speaks Spanish, she will sometimes use Spanish terms that come more naturally than their English counterparts- in fact, when taking notes in any language (including Mandarin), she will use y instead of and as a makeshift short-hand and that sometimes this slips into English conversation as well. Other Spanish words she’ll reach for in a conversation include paralelismo (parallelism, a word our group of Spanish-speaking friends found perfect for describing “parallel” situations), pero (but), and dónde está (where is he/she/it) (17). When asked why these specific terms were more immediate than their English equivalents, Don responded that maybe it was because their semantic meaning was more explicitly taught than it was in English. In the case of dónde está, the Spanish parsing and meaning was more instructed and verbalized than “where is he/she/it?” Paralelismo was taught to her in her senior year of high school a few weeks before it was taught in English class- the concept, though it transcended languages, was stored in her mind in Spanish. I asked her if this interchangeability was also true of Mandarin, and she wasn’t sure. With Spanish, many of the people that she interacted with on a day-today basis had no trouble in understanding when she switched one word for the other. However, with Mandarin, barely anybody she interacts with outside of class would be able to keep up, so she’s never had the opportunity (17). Don tells me that, when she was younger, she often got jealous of friends who could use words in other languages with their parents or siblings; because she was raised monolingual, there were no Mandarin words she would use instead of their English counterparts. Because the opportunity to learn Mandarin coincided with her leaving home, this specialized lexicon hasn’t had a chance to organically emerge. She doesn’t feel less entitled to her heritage as a BurmeseAmerican, but she mourns the chance to have that linguistic common ground with the Mandarin-speaking people in her childhood home (18, 29). Language isn’t about identity, race or nationality to Don Juan, but more a way to understand and connect with other people (20). She chose to keep learning Spanish instead of trying French in high school because of how wide-spoken it was in California and the southern Bay Area (and because Mandarin wasn’t offered) (10). Even though 4 she is only starting to learn Mandarin, she says that she won’t be any more or less Asian/Burmese four years from now; she will, however, be able to better communicate with her grandmother and extended paternal family, enabling a more complex understanding of their shared history (29). In the same vein, although she is learning Mandarin, she wishes she had a means to learn Burmese, the much more widely used language in Burma (which she never refers to as Myanmar) because it’s what her father “spoke growing up” (29). When I press as to why learning Burmese would change anything about her relationship with her father or her ancestry, she answers that is isn’t about changing the relationship itself, but the breadth of the communication. From her own experience, she knows that not natively knowing the grammar or vocabulary of a language can limit how authentically you can communicate in it (23). Don Juan doesn’t think she behaves differently in any given language per se, but she does think that her fluency in that respective language sometimes imposes limits on how naturally and clearly she can communicate. While she has full range of emotion and nuance in English, she has less of it in Spanish and even less of it in Mandarinthere are ideas in English that she could not express as richly in either of her other two languages (23). The reason why she is learning Mandarin isn’t because she thinks Mandarin will intensify or legitimize her ethnicity- it will hopefully enable her family to share more expansive and deep elements to their lives and their shared migrant history. She thinks that this same impediment is a big part of why learning a language is so hard and why she often gets very anxious before oral quizzes; it’s tough for students to put themselves in situations where they might be embarrassed in front of native speakers of that language. Don says that in Spanish she sometimes found herself on the judging side of that relationship despite not considering herself fluent, which is why she knows other people are also capable of the same behavior. Nonetheless, she maintains that learning new languages is one of the most rewarding educational experiences she’s had (24). In the future, Don Juan wants to become fluent in Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Burmese, Latin, Java, Python and CSS (whose fluency she defines as an understanding of the syntax and rules that govern it), and really wants to take a Linguistics course. For these languages, natural or no, she thinks that through knowing them she will be able to better engage the world around her (29). The way she describes her interpretation of language, I picture a football field: if you’re always playing on 5 yours, you always have the benefit of familiarity with your surroundings- however, your opponent (in this metaphor, your partner in conversation) doesn’t. Learning a new language is Don making the effort to play on their field instead. It’s not that the game has changed: the medium has. Whatever new field she chooses to play on the future, though, she is sure that a Spanish phrase or two will always accidentally find its way into her vocabulary.

Bilingual Interview

Connecting Communities through Language

Odinaka Oranekwu (1), 19 (2), is a sophomore at Bryn Mawr and was born in Boston, MA, raised in Lynn, MA (30 minutes from Boston), but her family is from Nigeria (3). Ody speaks two languages fluently, Ebo, the language in Nigeria and English (6). However, she is intermediate in Turkish and Spanish. Even though she knows four languages, she prefers that people address her as a bilingual (4). As a child she grew up speaking Ebo (5), and she consistently uses it whenever she is with her family or the Nigerian community today (8,9). But English was her first language she learned (7). Ody’s experience provided insight to a larger scope of bilingualism and she can connect and share common experiences with other bilingual communities.

Thinking of someone I knew who is bilingual to interview was not hard for me. My friend Ody was the first person I thought of and I believed she would be the perfect person to interview. Ody’s full name is Odinaka Oranekwu, but she prefers that everyone call her Ody (1). She is 19 years old (2) and was born in Boston, MA, however, her family is from Nigeria. Ody grew up in a city called, Lynn, MA, which is about 30 minutes outside of Boston (3). Even though Ody grew up in Lynn, she spent most of her time in Boston, because her school and church are located there. Boston is a very diverse city, so I knew that Ody was going to provide a lot of insight on her experience in being bilingual in a diverse community. Throughout the interview with Ody, I got a clear picture of how her experiences being in a diverse city allowed her to use her bilingualism to feel connected with other communities that are also bilingual. 

The Beginning
Ody is multilingual; she speaks English and Ebo fluently and Turkish and Spanish intermediately. However, she prefers people use the term bilingual to describe her (4,7), because she cannot fluently speak in Turkish and Spanish. English is her more dominant language because as a child, she learned to speak English first (6). However, she told me that she understood the Ebo language as a baby; she doesn’t know how, but she just did (5). She explained, “As a toddler, I understood the language, but I had trouble understanding the more formal Ebo or knowing the meaning of words out of conversation.” She described that she knew what a sentence would mean when she was being spoken to, but it was hard for her to pick apart the sentence and put pieces together to its correct meaning. For example, in a conversation, if someone mentioned the word spoon, she knew it means Ngagi, however, out of the conversational setting, she would not be able to identify a Ngagi with a spoon. 
But as Ody got older, she was encouraged to speak the Ebo language and use the Nigerian culture in many settings (25). Growing up, she was part of a Nigerian church in Boston. This was place where she could practice and perfect the Ebo language (8). The church encouraged the youth to speak Ebo or participate in the Ebo culture, such as dances, reading sermons, or Ebo class. Ody was part of the different dance groups of the church, and this allowed her to be more involved with the Nigerian culture. As part of the dance groups, it motivated her to keep learning and perfecting Ebo, and she felt more immersed in the community. She said, “Being part of the Ebo community allowed for the opening of new doors, and the further you go in, the more doors are opened.” She emphasized how being part of a community that speaks a different language allows for the opening of doors, such that, from being from Boston, it was easier to create connections with other bilingual communities. 

Speaking the Languages
Because Ody is fluent in both English and Ebo, I asked her if she ever mixes the two languages when she speaks to someone (17). She told me it depends on who she is speaking to. “If I am speaking to my mother or someone who is older in my family, I will do so accidentally. And if I am with my friends that know me well enough that I am fluent in Ebo, I might also mix up the languages.” But she also told me that if she was speaking to someone in a general context or someone she did not know her well enough, she wouldn’t mix the languages. It was clear to see that Ody is more aware on how she uses her languages, based on the setting she is in.
I have known Ody for about two years now, and just by being around her a lot, I asked her if her tone changes based on the situation she is in. She said that as an urban kid from Boston, she must code switch to fit the environment (23). When I asked her to explain what she meant, she said, “When I am in a class room setting or in an interview, my persona is as an academic. I am well-spoken and carefully choses my words in English. However, when I am with my parents, adults, or older cousins, I must speak Ebo; but I cannot actually ‘speak’” (9). When Ody told me that she cannot actually “speak” when she is with her family, I found that interesting and asked her to elaborate on what she means. She explained, “In the Nigerian culture, it is not my position to speak when I am with my family who are older than me, just because I am younger than them.” But she also explained that it is just with adults. When she is with her friends who are the same age group as her and does not know Ebo, she sometimes speaks in Ebo, but it is more of a joking thing because no one knows what she is saying. 
While speaking with Ody, I asked her if there were certain words or phrases that existed in Ebo, but not in English (21). “I know of this phrase called, Ka ife nlacha si a mii, and the direct translation in English means ‘The way that people lick sucks’. Because the Nigerian culture speaks in idioms and parables, it does not exactly mean what it translates to be in English. The saying means in context, ‘Wow, look how the time flows’ or ‘Look how things have come’”. When she first told me this, I was a bit confused because I have never heard of a saying like that in English. But when she explained it, it made a lot more sense. She said that her father uses it a lot and she understood it because she heard it being used in various contexts. But she also told me that if you were probably new to the Ebo language, it would not make sense to you. 

Importance of a Language
From a perceptive from someone who is not bilingual, I already knew the importance of language in our society today. However, when I asked Ody “What does it mean to you in your life to be bilingual” (18), she opened my eyes to a new perspective about being bilingual that I never thought of before. She said that, “By being bilingual you can learn and adapt to the different cultures and dialects and being able to put that into practice, allows me to feel like I am part of another community. It is essential to fit into and relate to multiple communities because language can be a barrier, but if you learn a language, it makes fitting into a community easier.” After listening to Ody’s response, it was clear to me how important being bilingual is in society today. Ody reassured to me that being bilingual is not just being able to speak another language, but how you use your bilingualism to form connections with other bilingual communities. Like Ody mentioned previously, language is one of the things that can be a barrier for many people, however, by learning a language, you can connect and share common experiences with others in different communities.

Darkness and Light of Being a Bilingual
——Language, Culture and Identity

Katya is a 19-year-old student studying at Bryn Mawr College (1,2). She is a multilingual who speaks English, Russian and German (4). She was born in America but is also a Russian heritage speaker since her mom is Russian (3,5). Her step dad is German and she went to Germany for high school (3,5). Katya considers English her dominant language, her Russian more at the level of understanding and German as quite limited (6,7). Their family still uses English to communicate as all three know English well enough, but before forming a new family, Katya’s mom talked to her young daughter in Russian a lot and still does so (8,9,10). She does not use German frequently, compared to other two languages she is more familiar with (8). Not only does she have interesting experience of using all these languages, Katya also has a lot to say about how each culture has influenced her way of perceiving the world and self-perception of her own identity. 


“It is actually never easy to be a bilingual. The barrier in communication caused by different identity as a bilingual or a monolingual, to me, is nearly impossible to overcome. People just won’t understand your opinions because these opinions are based on concepts from a culture they are not familiar with,” Katya confessed with a sign, “People just see speaking several languages as cool but they don’t really understand what does it actually mean to be a bilingual. It is somehow lonely.” If any opinions on being a bilingual ought to be said, Katya would be one of the most qualified people to have a stand to say something. Not only because she is a bilingual herself, but also because one of the languages together with the culture it carries has been deeply rooted in her life since childhood. This interview shall reveal an intimate connection between Katya and her second language – Russian – and a true story of loneliness due to this special bond.  
Katya was born in Philadelphia, PA and unsurprisingly speaks perfect English. What makes her family setting interesting is that her mother is a Russian who chose to marry an American and moved to United States. However, Katya’s parents got divorced and her mom raised young Katya on her own for years. Because of her mom’s original background, Katya has been immersed in Russian culture since her childhood. She grew up watching Russian cartoons and she shyly admitted that she still searches Russian cartoons on YouTube as her guilty pleasure. There is a small Russian community south-east of Philly where they used to go grocery shopping. Although they did not live close to that area, Katya still knew some kids in her neighborhood who were also from families with Russian background. “We seemed to share this close bond of Russian heritage,” said Katya. 
Since her mom talked to her in Russian a lot since she was a child, Katya could understand Russian perfectly but could not speak as well as she could understand Russian (11,12). For example, in the Russian class Katya and I take right now, we are learning to apply different case endings. Before taking this class, she did not know how to apply these grammar rules when expressing herself in Russian but she would have no trouble understanding other people’s sentences which obviously are constructed according to these rules. She also told an interesting anecdote about taking a violin lesson with a Russian teacher for years: “I could not speak Russian that well but that did not get in the way of the violin class. Because I could understand him perfectly and I did not need to talk that much during the lesson.” Considering her reading and writing skills, Katya expressed much regret that her mom did not spend much time teaching her how to read and write. “We started to do that for a while and soon forgot about it,” said Katya with a little embarrassment, “I think I should be considered a heritage speaker and it seems to be a general trend that heritage speakers would have inadequate reading and writing skills, compared to their speaking and understanding of that language.” That also explained why she wanted to take Russian from beginning even though she already knew a lot. 
Both Katya and her mom are very familiar with using English and Russian and consequently they use both languages to think or form ideas. However, it does appear to them that it is difficult to express their opinions in one language when these thoughts have been already formed in their mind previously with another language (15,23). Katya would ask her mom to speak Russian to her instead of English in the middle of the conversation to push her more on Russian speaking skills but her mom would refuse: “I have already been thinking in English and let me finish my thoughts. I cannot switch to think in Russian right now.” Katya herself also strongly agreed that there is this invisible barrier between two languages even for someone who totally masters two languages like her mom. Even at the level of forming ideas, difficulties of translating ideas between different languages already appear. 
After several years of raising Katya by herself, Katya’s mom married a German man, which leads to the introduction of a third language into Katya’s life (11,12). Unsatisfied with their daughter’s high school in Philly, the family decided to move to Germany so that Katya could have a better high school education in Europe. She ended up going to an international school in Munich where they lectured in English but still taught German in class. “It did not help [my German] as much as people think it would,” she laughed, “We did not use German that much because everybody in Germany seemed to know English well and as soon as you made an error or they detected an accent, they realized that German was not your first language and would change to English right away. It is very weird” (27). She was never forced to speak German in that two years of life in Munich and therefore did not improve much in terms of her German language skills in general. When I asked about her step dad’s role in that learning process, she admitted that her dad laughed at her accent every time she wanted to say something in German, which inevitably cut down her passion to keep practicing German. “I know that he did not do that in a mean way and I laughed at him when he tried to speak Russian as well” said by Katya with an obvious smirk. 
Although neither of her parents are native English speakers, the three of them talk to each other in English mainly (10). But apparently Katya and her mom have been communicating with Russian as a secret code so that her step dad would not figure out what they are saying. Until now they still watch Russian movies together and enjoy this private Russian atmosphere with each other. She also admitted that she prefers using Russian vocabularies or phrases when expressing strong emotions (17). “When I talk about my parrot, I always use Russian due to deep feelings of affection,” she explained, “My favorite word to describe him is ‘пухлый’ which means ‘fluffy’ in English.” She does not find much equivalent emotion in the translated English word, compared with the Russian one. All these interesting anecdotes seem to yield to us that Russian is a very intimate language for Katya and that it does create a closer emotional connection for her when she is using it. Expressing my sympathy for that poor step dad who is excluded because of inadequacy in Russian, I moved on to her more personal experience and insights on cultures and identity as a bilingual (she is very modest to insist calling herself as a bilingual instead of a trilingual person for her limited German). 
Anyone who knows Katya’s rich language and culture background in Russian would imagine that she would have some Russian friends. But surprisingly, Katya does not have any actual Russian friends who can talk Russian with her. She explained her hesitation to make Russian friends with a frustrating experience before. When she was playing violin at a music festival, she had the chance to talk with some of the Russian members in the orchestra. However, her identity as a Russian heritage speaker seemed to provoke this mean attitude from these Russian students (27,29). “They were like: ‘Oh, she thinks that she is a Russian but she is not’.” Her vivid imitation let both of us burst into laughter. But she did admit that it was also her fault that she did not give it another try since then. Compared to Russians, Katya said that her American friends are more chilled with her identity as an American-born Russian heritage speaker because they think the fact that she can speak another language is super cool. Believing that she had been immersed into both American and Russian cultures, Katya thinks that she definitely appreciates the openness in American culture more than if she had not had the chance to know Russian culture (19,21). 
It is not fair to say that Katya favors American culture over Russian culture since right now Katya is considering majoring in Russian. She personally prefers Russian to English in terms of literature (21). Although English as a language has so many amazing literature pieces, Russian literature somehow has more impact on her even if she had only listened to her mother telling Russian stories to her as a child and has not even technically read a book entirely in Russian. She is especially interested in Russian music since she has a such rich music background playing violin. The biggest benefit of being a bilingual, to Katya, is that she is more open–minded to other cultures she has encountered and therefore forms her own point of view, which consists of concepts from more than one culture (19,28). For example, when she talked about Russian ballet which she also did for a longtime back then, she did have very unique opinions. She had such high praise for Russian ballet and thinks that “anything other ballet style cannot even be compared to Russian ballet” (21). In terms of ballet, she raised her own point of view that the openness of Americans has a negative impact that they encourage children who do not have a suitable body size to do ballet, which is essential to move onto a professional ballet career. I believe that she manages to see two cultures both in a critical way so that she not only notices drawbacks in both but also sees the positive side of both. For me, Katya has so many special thoughts towards all kind of things which I really love about her, but she did complain that sometimes there is this gap between her and her other friends who are not multilingual because they are not able to understand her frame of perceiving the world.
If she has to come up with the biggest disadvantage of being a bilingual for her, Katya said that it has to be the missing sense of truly belonging to a particular culture (19,28). As Russians do not seem to accept her as one of them, her American friends, though more open and welcome, do not see her as an American either (26). Although so well immersed into both cultures, Katya said that she does not really belong to either of them and she herself cannot simply classify herself into either of the categories. We then diverged a little from the current topic and talked about the awkward geographical position of Russia, which Asian countries describe as an eastern European country while Europe tends to classify into Asia. “Like Russia, I am awkwardly stuck in the middle of two identities” she explained, “I cannot say I am a Russian for I have not yet been to Russia even once. But I cannot say that I am just an American neither because I know I am more than that.” 
However, also due to her openness towards all kind of cultures, Katya inevitably falls in love with other languages as well, which she also appreciated (19). One of her violin teachers during her childhood was Japanese and introduced the Japanese culture to her. “She is more like a big sister to me and she is the one who brought me to my first Japanese restaurant to teach me how to eat sashimi in the correct way,” recalled Katya. She is very interested in Japanese pop culture right now, like manga and animation, and therefore wants to learn Japanese some time during college. Other than that, Katya is also attracted by the beauty of France and its language. Since her grandfather on her biological father’s side moved to Paris, she went to visit him periodically and consequently got familiar with the intriguing culture there. Katya believes that she is very lucky to be a bilingual at the same time which makes her have the opportunity to interact with more cultures. And she would love to have a multilingual partner because that might open the gate to another culture for her and also she could have someone who could truly understand her unique mind shaped by so many languages (30). 
“I won’t stop appreciating all the benefits I have for being a bilingual and I won’t regret being one neither,” Katya concluded as we approach the end of our interview, “but the confusion and loneliness that come from it [being a bilingual] are real and impossible to ignore as well.”

Samantha Forestier Linguistics October 6, 2017 Strengthening Language to Strengthen Culture Kelvin Cheng Bo is 19 and was born in Trinidad (1,2,3). He grew up half of his life in Trinidad and the other half in the United States (3). He speaks English and Toisanese (4). He learned both English and Toisanese when he was young (5). Now he is fluent in English and uses it as his dominant language and he struggles communicating in Toisanese (6,7). He uses English in almost all of the areas of his life (8). He only uses Toisanese when speaking to his parents and other older relatives at home, he has always spoken to the rest of his family in English (8,9). Multilingualism is a quality that many people carry proudly, but sometimes the most interesting stories of language come from those who keep it hidden. When choosing a subject for this interview, my mind did not instantly wander to Kelvin who I have been close to my four years in high school and continue talking to through college. Sometimes I forget that he is bilingual because he mainly uses just English. Coming from a diverse high school where hearing different languages constantly being spoken through the hallway, it was surprising that Kelvin kept his other language hidden. This project was an exciting opportunity to learn more about Kelvin and his experiences being bilingual. Kelvin Cheng Bo is 19 years old and was born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago (1,2,3). He is part of a Chinese immigrant family and his four older sisters were all born in China. Kelvin and his family lived in Mirabella Trinidad until he was about ten years old, then they moved to the United States (3). He lived in Malden, a city that is located about ten minutes north of Boston (3). Malden is a city known for having the most diverse schools in Massachusetts and being home to many different types of people from all over the world. 2 Kelvin has been living in Malden since his childhood and now attends college at UMASS Lowell. He is able to speak both English and Toisanese, which is a dialect of Cantonese (4). Kelvin learned Toisanese from his parents at a young age (5). At the same time, he also learned English from his older sisters and from his outside environment, as English is the official language of Trinidad (5). When Kelvin began school in Trinidad, English took over and now he is fluent in it (6). In Toisanese he is comfortable speaking, but he still needs to work on it (6). He is unable to read or write in Toisanese and only two of his sisters are able to read some of it (6). We went in further to talk about the differences in the English that he uses. Kelvin divided his English into “American English” and “Trini-Style English.” The English that Kelvin first learned was in Trinidad, while being surrounded by people who have Trinidadian accents. Naturally, Kelvin picked up this accent while learning English on the island. A story Kelvin shared with me regarding his Trini-style English was when he first came to the United States and began school. Kelvin entered fourth grade in the United States and he had a strong Trinidadian accent. His classmates were confused and thought his accent was funny and would repeatedly ask “Why do you talk like that?”. The students were confused that he didn’t speak with a stereotypical American or Chinese accent. Even the school administration didn’t expect him to speak English properly so they put him in English Learner Classes for his first few days of school. Kelvin’s Trini-English has become scarce in use, and he mainly only uses it with his sisters. I have been with Kelvin and he has received a phone call from a sister and he automatically switches into his Trinidadian accent without even realizing it. With time he has increased his use of “American English.” 3 After being in America and realizing that he talks differently than all of his classmates, he began to consciously and subconsciously pick up a “standard American accent.” He was able to do this relatively quickly and doesn’t remember when he stopped using his Trinidadian accent. He believes that it was a gradual change. When listening to Kelvin use his American English you would never suspect that it is not his native accent and that he speaks an entirely different language. Unfortunately, he said that sometimes he has been racially profiled and people don’t expect him to be able to speak English as well he does before talking to him (24). Through talking to Kelvin, he made it clear that English is his dominant language. When Kelvin is out in public he always uses English (12). He thinks in English and he consumes all of his media in English (13-16). He is much more comfortable with this language in comparison to Toisanese. Speaking Toisanese has been a struggle for Kelvin, and he has never felt fully comfortable speaking it. He associates his Toisanese language to his Chinese culture which only exists at home with his parents and his other relatives (8). His parents speak very little English so when he communicates with them he has to speak in Toisanese (8). He is able to slip in some English phrases when talking to his parents such as names, dates and days of the week (17). He sometimes has to go to his sisters for help communicating with his parents because they are more comfortable with the language. In order to have a conversation with his relatives, Kelvin has to think in English, then he translates in his head to Toisanese (22). Kelvin believes that he’s been able to gain more fluency in Toisanese as he has gotten older (11). He is able to use context clues and prior knowledge to communicate with his parents, but still wishes that he has a better understanding so the conversation is able to flow easier (11). 4 (Entire Paragraph is 21) Kelvin was able to share with me a little more about his language that English speakers may not realize. Toisanese has some terms that English does not have. He explained to me that there’s a term in Chinese (pronounced [gŋyɪthi]) that explains the state you get in when you eat fried foods, or foods that are not good for you and you feel sick. There’s also another term pronounced “[sθlʊŋ],” which is a word for the side dishes that are eaten with rice. I asked him how this was different than just regular side dishes and he said it was culturally different and it was difficult for him to explain how. Another interesting language difference is the way different family members are addressed. He explained to me that there are different terms to refer to aunts and uncles that differ depending on age and maternal or paternal side. He told me that it is hard to be in touch with his Chinese culture because he feels so removed from it after living in Trinidad and the United State for his whole life, but speaking Toisanese gives him a little bit of connection. Kelvin has been supported by his family and friends in being bilingual (25). His English is completely fluent so many people are impressed and surprised when they realize that he’s able to speak two languages (25). Kelvin gets the opposite reaction when he’s trying to speak Toisanese. To other Chinese speakers he is viewed as a non-native speaker because his sentences may sound choppier and he may need help with words (24). This connects to a frustration that he has with bilingualism because many Chinese speakers assume that he’s able to communicate with them. Many times they may not be speaking in the Toisanese dialect and he’s not comfortable enough with the language to communicate fully in other dialects (26). Kelvin wants to work on his Toisanese going into the future. He feels that his bilingualism has been a great advantage to him and has even been able to help him get a job (26). He doesn’t 5 mind if his future partner isn’t bilingual, and he said that he would love if his children were (28). He is concerned that he may not be strong enough in Toisanese to be able to raise his children bilingual (28). If he were to learn more languages he would want to learn more dialects of Chinese to be able to communicate with a wider range of people (29). Kelvin looks forward to growing and learning in both English and Toisanese to combine his American, Caribbean and Chinese cultures. 
Madhumita Gupta 2:25pm LING-101 November 16th 2017 Abstract In this paper, I interviewed Saummya Mehra, a Bryn Mawr international student who speaks Hindi, English and German. The paper focuses on Mehra’s experience in America so far, specifically how different the cultures are, and how she has dealt with the differences and made her own connections. Mehra also speaks about choosing to learn languages from outside India, speaking about her wish to learn different languages in order to connect with people of different cultures. Her choice to learn a language not native to India reflects a growing shift in Indian culture, and the slowly decreasing number of people who speak local languages. Mehra’s experiences as a native speaker of Hindi in America have been comforting so far, as people have encouraged her to share her culture through her language. All in all, Mehra loving studying languages, and would hope her children grow up to be bilingual as well. Madhumita Gupta 2:25pm LING-101 November 16th 2017 “Chalta Hai”: From India to America, Hindi to English Saummya Mehra is an 18 year old student attending Bryn Mawr College as a freshman, part of the Class of 2021 (1,2). As an international student from India (3), Mehra is a native speaker of two languages, and has learned one other by choice(4). Mehra is fluent in Hindi and in English, and has chosen to take German as her foreign language. Mehra grew up in New Delhi, the capital of India and located in the north. “I’ve spoken Hindi and English since forever,” Mehra says, “and I started German as an out of school project.(5)” Mehra says she spoke English in her home as a child (10), but that has not influenced her Hindi fluency, as Hindi surrounded her everywhere else. Mehra says that depending on the situation or location, the language she favors changes (7). “I speak Hindi and English quite often, and I end up favoring a mix of the two around my friends and family, because everyone I know speaks both those languages”(8, 9), Mehra explains. “I feel very comfortable speaking either English or Hindi at any point, because I consider myself a native speaker of both. I think I have to work on my German a little more, because I didn’t grow up speaking it, so I am not as comfortable.”(6) India has the largest English speaking population in the world, as well as having over 100 local dialects; most people in India speak English, Hindi and the local dialect. In South India, the local dialect can change from town to town, given the concentration of different cultures and religious sects in the area. In New Delhi, where Mehra grew up, people often bring their local dialects with them, and the average person can often speak up to 5 or 6 languages . “It was interesting to come here and realize that most people only ever learn and speak English — there isn’t a separate local language barrier like there is in India, because language is so standardized here.” “I was always encouraged by my family to speak different languages, and I enjoy speaking different languages too,” says Mehra (27). “Taking German inspired me to learn more languages, because I like starting things from scratch. It’s a completely new experience that I 1 really enjoy.”(20) Mehra says she will try and continue learning more languages in the future. “In India, everyone seems to know more than one language, because Hindi is the mother tongue, but local languages will always be present.” Her move to America this year has only bolstered her excitement to learn new languages. “It’s so cool to interact with people here in other languages, because everyone has such an open reaction to it. It’s a cool skill to have, and it opens up many new avenues of communication.”(19) In the United States, the clear dominant language is English, and there have been many nationalistic movements across the country to force people to assimilate, and speak nothing but English. The idea of ballots being in different languages has sparked outrage in many groups – the argument is, if you came to America, speak English. While this statement ignores the fact the English came from England and that Native American languages such as Iroquoian, Siouan and Navajo were actually the first languages to dominate the landscape before colonists arrived, the movement has nonetheless gained traction. The idea plays into the anti-immigrant, isolationist rhetoric of our current presidency, and people who speak more than one languages have often been forced to drop their native tongues in favor of assimilation. Mehra, however, says that she has faced no such discrimination, stating that “speaking Hindi with other Indian nationals here makes me feel at home.”(29) “It was so nice to talk to people here in Hindi the first week — I felt like a bit of home had come with me.” Speaking a native language brings a sense of comfort to Mehra, because it reminds her of the culture at home (21). India’s culture is often seems to be much warmer and more welcoming than American culture for an immigrant going from a majority to a minority. “There are phrases in Hindi that just don’t appear in English, but I don’t use them very often anyways,” says Mehra (22). Phrases such as “chalta hai,” the most literal translation being, “it goes on,” indicate the kind of resiliency and forgiving culture that India has. “I do have the traditional Indian accent,” says Mehra, “but I haven’t seen anyone make fun of me for it or point it out. Not to my face anyway.” The accent comes from the difference in pronunciation of words. In Hindi, words are spoken with no emphasis on any specific syllable, rather, no stress is placed on any part of the word at all. In English, a certain part of the word is always emphasized, usually the defining part of the word. In addition to this tonal difference, 2 Hindi does not differ between the “w” and the “v” sound, only having the “v” in the alphabet. It also differs between sounds like “j” and “jh” with different letters altogether, which is why it is so difficult for non-native speakers to pronounce Indian names. “It’s so odd to me that people cannot pronounce my name correctly — it was always one of the simpler names in India, but people here have changed my name in some really weird ways,” says Mehra. The letters and sounds used in the names are often simply not part of the set of sound used most often by English speakers. Mehra says her experience being bilingual has been supported and helpful so far, and that most people can tell she is a native speaker of Hindi. “When I talk to people in Hindi, like in India, after a few minutes I think they can tell that I am a native speaker, because I use slang and I don’t have an accent on any of my words. I think my Indian accent confuses some people here though — they don’t realize I am also a native English speaker.”(26) In the quickly modernizing India, English has become a widely spoken language, the language first being introduced through the British colonialists. Even now, the struggle between modern language and reverting to old traditions remains in many parts of the country. For example, names of many cities were changed to allow British citizens to pronounce them easier. The government of India has now been taking steps to change the names of many Indian cities back to their original names in an effort to preserve their culture, because many of the old languages that people spoke are dying out. Language conservation efforts have been going on all across India, because due to more connectivity and urbanization, many people are choosing to focus on learning major languages like Hindi and English rather than focusing on local, traditional languages. Mehra plans to branch out, saying “I want to learn different languages, rather than focusing on one part of the world. I want to be able to talk to many different people, travel the world. I want to experience radically different cultures. Even though cultures differ in India, at the end of the day, it’s still India. I think the idea of being able to talk to people of different cultures is so cool.”(28) Mehra is bilingual, but she has no plans to limit herself to two languages. As an immigrant from India, she enjoys learning about different cultures, and plans to continue immersing herself in different languages and concepts. Being bilingual, she says, has shaped a 3 huge part of her life — it has allowed her to connect with different populations and create her own identity as someone who has a hand in both worlds. “I would want my kids to be bilingual. It would carry on the culture in my family, and they would be able to interact with a lot more people. My experience so far has been so good, and I would want them to have the same experiences I did.” (30).

Linguistics 101: Bilingualism Interview
Elizabeth Gregory (1), is a 19-year-old female from Kerrville, Texas (2)(3). She would describe herself as a multilingual person; she speaks Spanish and English and is 70-80% fluent in ASL. (4)(6). When speaking about the process that lead to her acquisition of these languages she explained that her father is a fishing and hunting guide for Latin and South America, so growing up she spoke Spanish at home and spent her summers as a young child in South America. English was her first language and she picked up ASL this past summer during her gap year in Houston. Elizabeth struggled with insomnia, so she decided to use those wasted hours into learning ASL. (5). Between Spanish and English, in terms of usage, she states that English is dominant, especially since coming to college. (7).  Now that Elizabeth is at Bryn Mawr she only uses Spanish when with her family, but speaks English at school, with friends and the general public and takes and ASL class at Swarthmore. (8).  When living at home, growing up, a majority of the time she spoke Spanish with her family, but now it has developed into a mix of English and Spanish. (9).

Bilingualism and/or multilingualism consists of both spoken and signed languages; this identity gives you a new and unique perspective on languages and the cultures surrounding them. Being multilingual does not only mean that they can communicate in multiple languages, but they can also understand and immerse themselves into new cultures and communities. These identifiers are powerful, especially in relation to sign language because they help build bridges between the hearing and the deaf and/or hearing impaired. Having the ability to sign is incredible because it gives one the ability to connect to a community that shares your language, but communicates differently, visually rather than vocally. It is a connection built between these two communities that have so much in common, but also many differences between the two. With learning a foreign language, you, as a speaker, are able to connect to people globally, but with sign language we as multilingual speakers have the ability to connect and converse with people in our own backyard; there is a human connection that is formed when we are able to communicate with people in their own language, whether it be signed or spoken. 
The person I interviewed, Elizabeth, considers herself a multilingual person; she speaks English, Spanish, and she is 70-80 % fluent in ASL. (4). Spanish is a globally encompassed language because it is the second largest spoken language, according to Ethnologue: Languages of the World which states that there are over 437 million Spanish speakers in the world and Liz is one of them. She was born in Austin, Texas but was raised in Kerrville, Texas; rural Texas is known for its Spanish speaking population, but this is not where or why she learned Spanish. (3). Liz learned Spanish because her father is a hunting and fishing travel agent in Argentina and Chile, so she spent her summers in South America and her parents enforced Spanish as the language spoken at home by the time she was 3 years old. Spending her summers in South America forced her and her family to learn Spanish so growing up she spoke Spanish way more consistently than she did English. (5).  Spanish is a romance language and Elizabeth, who is 19 years old, now just speaks Spanish weekly with her family for fun, but she has lost much, close to 50%, of her Spanish because she hasn’t used it consistently in the past 4 years. (2, 6, 7, 11). While she has lost a majority of her Spanish she does have a Spanish keyboard on her iPhone, but that is as far as her Spanish technology goes because she watches all her television and does all her reading in English. (13).
ASL was a completely different learning experience for Liz, at 17 years old she was struggling with insomnia and had an extra eight hours which were being used for Netflix rather than anything useful and so she decided to learn sign language. Coincidentally two months later she became aware her aunt had taught at a Deaf university and then she went on a cruise where she met a Deaf young man. After meeting and communicating with him while on holiday she realized that ASL was ‘the coolest thing she had ever seen’ and she began to take a class a soon as she returned. (5, 10). She now views ASL as her dominant language and signs daily in school, with friends, and even when she is speaking with non ASL speakers. Over the summer she lost some of her ability to sign but is gaining it back through her ASL class at Swarthmore, talking with her classmates, and teaching her friends. (7). When living in Houston she was taking an ASL class and attending a Deaf church, she has a lot of Deaf friends so she was signing constantly, but this past summer she did not sign at all. (11). While she did not have the ability to keep up her signing she did learning, she has ASL books and an ASL dictionary on her phone. What makes her thought process so individualized is that she can think in sign language; when signing she has an instinct that wasn’t there prior. Her instincts are so strong that it has begun to irritate people because she now signs with emphasis and when thinking she now instinctually has begun to use ASL language patterns when speaking. (22). The emotions she exhibits of anger or sadness are extremely apparent and the motions are extremely fun for her to do and make. When she is angry and conversing with an English speaker she uses harsh signs to emphasize her anger or sadness, but no one understands what she is saying or doing. (16).
The topic of combining and mixing languages arose and Elizabeth explained that she only mixes up English and Spanish when she is at a Chinese restaurant because she recognizes the environment in not an English speaking one and her brain automatically goes to the other spoken language she knows that is not English and the desire is to say ‘gracias’ to the Chinese waitress. (17). Growing up, Liz travelled quite a bit with her family so every place they visited they learned a decent amount of the language. So, she now knows a bit of Chinese, Turkish, and Greek. Because of her ability to travel as a child it has changed the way she perceives cultures and the influence they can have on individuals. What is so special to her is that she now has access to an entire culture; to her the Deaf culture which she describes as rich, amazing, and fascinating and has created a window into a world she did not know existed. Adventure and access have been created through her ASL language development. Growing up languages were always a part of who she is and this has now translated into the next chapter of her life which included being diagnosed with a nerve disorder. A representation, as someone who is legally disabled, beating what used to be a disability is incredible and makes her feel empowered. She chose ASL when she got sick and was in a wheelchair. She explained to me that sign language represents to her when God closes a door he opens a window. Her perception of ASL has changed; when she was living on a ranch in small town Texas she thought learning ASL was just a fun experience or was just for entertainment. But, when she moved to Houston she started meeting and communicating with the Deaf community and it went from being a hobby to a magical thing where she could communicate with people the average person couldn’t. ASL is magical: ‘I can hear with my eyes and talk with her hands. Really grown to appreciate it.’ (18, 20).
Liz does not associate a specific personally with deafness, but with the idea that it was once a disability and now is not because they have sign language and are connected and can succeed in society like anyone else and to her that is important. But, she identifies more with the Spanish culture of Argentina and Chile because she has spent so much time with it, steeped in it since she was 5 years old. What makes Spanish so interesting to her is that the language has many idioms that English does not and they are usually indicative of the Argentine and Chilean culture she was immersed in. The language is empathic and celebratory, while ASL has idioms that the spoken English language does not have and these phrases do not translate well into spoken sentences. (20, 21). At an event Liz attended she attempted to sign an English idiom and everyone was confused. They signed back to her “Train gone sorry” which means the ‘ship has sailed’ and she kept wondering what train? What does that even mean. The behavior when speaking or signing are completely different; to Elizabeth when she speaks Spanish she feels powerful and in her words ‘sassier’. Like the phrase, “Snap my fingers in a z formation” and with ASL, coming from a hearing perspective, she was enamored because their inability to hear vocal emphasis they use emphasis in their signs and motions which makes it dramatic to her. Body language/ non-manual signs (facial expressions, look, eyebrows) represent that everything means something and everything has a purpose. Every single motion tells a story and because of this she feels like a storyteller when communicating and feels a heightened level of dramatic elements. (23)
One of the many aspects that make ASL and Spanish so different is the perception of accents and the connection to ability. When Liz was younger, around 8 years old, she had perfected her accent to the degree that people believed she was from Latin America. She grew up speaking Spanish and had immersed herself so far into the culture that she could pass as a native among other native speakers. But with ASL, she explained to me she could never pass as a native because in sign language you can tell the difference between someone who has been signing for 40 years as an interpreter and who is hearing and someone who grew up Deaf. There is a visible difference between the two and there is no way for her physically to sign like a Deaf person, no matter the practice. (24). Regardless of the practice she implements native signers have an instinct and can pick up on slight differences that differ those who are hearing ASL speakers and those who sign and cannot hear. The support she has received in relation to her multilingualism is astounding; as a child, her parents enforced the speaking of Spanish in her home, it was “like eating your veggies but with Rosetta Stone.” And with ASL everyone she has met or talks with is fascinated, whether they know someone in community or not. Everybody is so excited for her and they all want to learn a bit, even if it is just how to sign their names. The idea of discouragement arose and she explained to me that  when she was first learning to sign, she would sit in the kitchen while her parents talked and ate dinner and she would sign everything they said for her to practice getting better and faster. In movies, she would finger spell everything and after a while it began to drive her parents and friends insane, they told her “ It’s great and all but can you stop please.” But it was part of her learning process and it is what the catalyst to what helped her to sign so quickly. She referred to it as disdain rather than discouragement.  (25)
To Liz there are no bad aspects to being multilingual only good parts. She believes everything has become more accessible, for example she can speak to a fellow ASL speaker or a Spanish speaking individual at any time. Over the past year, she taught GED classes in a Hispanic part of Houston and because of her language abilities she could help students in ways other teachers could not because she had the ability to explain concepts in their native language. Not only that, but from a hiring perspective knowing ASL and passable Spanish is a massive bonus in the work force. (26). Growing up speaking a foreign language and now knowing sign language has given Liz a greater appreciation of the world around her and she wants to pass that understanding onto her children. Studies show that different parts of the brain are stimulated for language and on top of that ASL stimulates a different part of the brain as well. She explained to me that baby ASL is an easier form of sign language and is extremely helpful to newborns and toddlers because it gives children the ability to communicate visually rather than verbally much earlier. To Liz, teaching her children at least some ASL is essential, but most importantly an affinity and appreciation of other cultures because ASL isn’t just a language but one also learns the culture and the dos and don’ts and that is incredibly important. Liz already knows three languages and she is just beginning; she now wants to learn Russian because to her it is a fascinating language and she loves Russia. Most importantly she wants to study abroad in Russia, but refuses to unless she knows at least a bit of the language.

Peng Jin (Jackson) 11/16/2017 Professor Lillehaugen Ling 101: Introduction to Linguistics Against All Obstacles: Journey to Becoming a Bilingual Scott Kzarsky is a 19-year-old bilingual speaker of Japanese and English (1, 2, 4). Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he grew up in Mount Laurel, New Jersey (3). His mom is Japanese, and his dad is an American who speaks limited Japanese (4). He began to learn Japanese and English at an early age, and he considers himself a native speaker in both languages (5). He speaks English more often than Japanese because he goes to school at Haverford College. When he is in the U.S, English is his dominant language (7). Interestingly, when he is in Japan, Japanese becomes his dominant language (7). Within his family, he mostly speaks English, but when Scott and his mom want to talk behind his dad’s back, they speak Japanese to each other (9). Some family members from his dad’s side were strongly against him learning Japanese when he was young (25), and he also stumbled upon many other obstacles along his continuous journey to embrace his true self. Once ambivalent and a little embarrassed about his ethnic identity, Scott has now fully embraced both his American and Japanese sides, and he feels freer than ever. When Scott was a kid, he was much more fluent in Japanese than in English. (5) His dad was always on business trips around the world, so Scott spent most of his childhood with his mom (5). “I was and still am very close with my mom, and we speak Japanese to each other. At the age of seven, my Japanese vocabulary was way larger than my English vocabulary. My English was actually pretty bad. (5)” He had to take another year of Pre-K because back then he didn’t really know how to speak English (25). Scott had studied at a Japanese-speaking elementary school for 4 years since his first grade (11). When he was in fifth grade, he started to do homeschool with his mom. (11) Since homeschool, he had stopped actively studying Japanese, and his Japanese reading and writing skills “got really rusty” (11). He is happy that he is taking a Japanese language course that is helping him 2 gradually getting his Japanese back (11). The process of learning Japanese was never easy and smooth for Scott. He has even faced constant discouragements and judgments from his family members. When Scott was little, his grandfather on his dad’s side strongly opposed him learning Japanese, especially after Scott had to take another year of Pre-K because of his bad English (25). His grandfather was mad at Scott’s mom for teaching him Japanese. He also held the view that English is better than Japanese, so Scott should only study the better language (25). What’s more, his aunt hates immigrants in general, so she dislikes family members who speak a language other than English (25). As a result, when the young Scott and his mom were with his dad’s family (who are all white Americans), he didn’t feel comfortable responding to his mom in Japanese (25). At the same time, many people in Scott’s life encourage and support him to embrace his Japanese heritage. “My mom required my bilingualism, so I didn’t have a choice (25).” As Scott’s first teacher of Japanese, his mom is the one person who supported him to study Japanese through many difficult times. There was a smile on his face when he said, “With my mom’s determination, there is no way I am not bilingual. (25).” Scott went through a period from seventh grade to his freshmen year of high school when he was paranoid about showing his Japanese side, and he was also embarrassed to speak Japanese (19). His perceptions of his bilingualism were then changed because of the bilingual friends he made in high school (19). There were many international students at his high school, and he became friends with many of them. “Unlike myself back then, they were really proud of being bilinguals. Hanging out with them made me realize how cool it is to be a bilingual and to have experienced both Japanese and American cultures (19).” Many of his high school friends are Chinese, so he wishes he knew more Chinese (29). “I feel kind of bad, because my Chinese friends speak more Japanese than I speak Chinese. Now I can only curse in Chinese, so I definitely want to learn more (29).” Scott told me that regardless of the language he is speaking, Japanese culture carries over more in his behaviors (20). It was not until one of his friends brought it up last week did 3 he realize that he would actually bow to everyone he meets (20). Also, if something from the inside spills out when he gets emotional in a tennis match, it would be in Japanese (16). In his words, “When I get angry during a tennis match, I will curse in Japanese, and it’s very natural for me to do so (16).” Interestingly, he dreams in either Japanese or English, but never dreams in both languages (15). His happier dreams and family dreams are all in Japanese, whereas he usually has nightmares in English (15). “I reflect on my bad days only in English, because all the problems I have are in English. I think that for me, Japanese is a happier language (15).” Unlike some bilinguals, he rarely mixes Japanese and English when he speaks either language. In elementary school, he was taught the importance of keeping the two languages separate (14). “Elementary school teachers always say, ‘don’t use English too much when you are speaking Japanese’, and I tried my best to follow their advice (14).” He only mixes Japanese and English a little bit when he talks to his Japanese friends in the U.S, but he never mixes the two languages when he talks to his parents. “I have accidentally spoken to dad in Japanese before, but it was not actually mixing the two languages. It has only happened once or twice in my life. I never make that mistake with my mom. That’s really interesting. Between me and my mom, we only speak Japanese.” Besides the fact that Scott uses English and Japanese separately, his English self and Japanese self are also pretty separate (14). He thinks that it is because his life is mostly here and there, either in Mount Laurel or in Tokyo (14). To Scott, being a bilingual means being a native speaker in two different places (18). “In Japan, people think I am Japanese. In the U.S, people think I am American (18).” Scott feels very confident speaking Japanese in Japan, although he only goes to Tokyo to visit his family in the summer. Last summer, when he was buying a Ping Pong paddle in a sports shop in Tokyo, he talked to a stranger about a recent Ping Pong tournament. Then the stranger asked Scott, “Do you go to local high school around here?” Scott responded, “No. I go to school in the U.S.” (18) He takes pride in the fact that he speaks great Japanese though he lives in the U.S (18). Nowadays, Scott and his mom will still be given looks sometimes when they speak 4 Japanese in public in U.S, but he doesn’t care anymore (27). He is very proud that he can speak Japanese (27). “Even some of the family members still don’t like me and my mom just because we also speak Japanese, but I don’t care. Sometimes I would speak only Japanese at a family dinner just to piss them off (25).” Scott also thinks that it is rare to be a bilingual of Japanese and English, so he would want his children to learn at least both Japanese and English (28). Having stepped over the barriers set by the society and even some of his family members, Scott has now truly and completely embraced both his Japanese and American sides, and he has never been more positive towards his identities. After fighting his way through the darker times he once had, he is now very grateful that he was raised to be a bilingual and a person with two cultural backgrounds. “Today I think my mom made the best decision in the world. Being a bilingual is amazing.” (25)

Haley Nolan Linguistics 101 Prof. Brook Lillehaugen November 16, 2017 Multilingualism: A Side You Might Not See One of my best friends from high school is Sabine Tessono (1), age 18 (2). She is a speaker of English, Haitian Creole, and French (4). She grew up in Massachusetts a few towns over from me, and we went to school in Boston together (3). I’ve always admired the fact that Sabine knows multiple languages, as I’ve been the type to try and fail to pick up foreign language. I chose to interview her about her experiences with her language because I wanted to see more through her lens into multilingualism and what it’s like, as well as see a side of her I often didn’t in high school. There were only a few times I got the chance to hear Sabine talk about what her languages mean to her, so this was a way for me to learn more about multilingualism in her life. Sabine has known English her whole life, with Haitian Creole introduced around age 6 and French introduced in middle school (5). English, to her, is the language her Haitian immigrant parents gave her in order to live and succeed in the United States (10). She considers herself fluent in English, and it is her dominant language in day-to-day life (6, 7, 8). Haitian Creole is a more personal language, meant for Sabine’s family (10). Her parents made her learn it, but she made sure to give their reasoning. She told me, “My parents just didn't think me [not] learning Creole [would] be an issue until they saw at the age of 6 that I wouldn't speak anything but English.” After that, they started teaching her. Her knowledge of Haitian Creole is speakingbased, and it is now the primary language her parents use to speak to her at home (6, 9). However, while she does use the language a lot, she often still uses English to respond (8). As for French, Sabine is mostly fluent when it comes to reading and writing, but has some trouble speaking (6). She took French in school in order to better understand her French-Canadian family, both in language and in culture (10). It was relatively easy for her to pick up, she said: “Creole helped me learn French extremely fast… I could understand the words because they were basically the same in Creole or just slightly altered.” It is definitely the language she uses least, almost exclusively in a school setting or around French-speaking family members (8). 2 Among all three languages, the only one Sabine feels she’s lost fluency in is French, but she still has a good hold on it (11). While she knows these languages well, Sabine emphasized that these languages are almost always used in different contexts. At home, she uses English and Creole to speak with her family, but at school she always uses English unless she’s in French class (12). At her job at Sears, Sabine uses almost exclusively English. Every once in a while, though, there are Haitian customers who come in who she can only help using Creole (12). It was very interesting that something so personal to her could come in handy at work, even allowing her to help people who might not have been able to find what they were looking for. In terms of media and other usage, she also distinguished between her languages. While her phone settings are in English and she watches television in English, Sabine talks on the phone in Creole often, as well as reads both English and French novels (13). This part of our conversation made Sabine laugh, and she smiled as she told me that her father likes to watch sports in Spanish since he speaks it. I asked her if she had picked any up; “only sports terms” was her giggly reply. Sabine’s multilingualism doesn’t just affect speaking, listening, and reading, though; it affects the way she thinks. I was surprised to hear from one of my best friends that she actually does think in English and Haitian Creole often, as I guess I had grown to assume that she only actively thought in English (14). English is still dominant for her, and she described her brain as filtering all three languages in English and translating back to speak again. Having never had fluency in other languages, I found the fact that she could seemingly so easily translate mentally impressive, to say the least. This ability actually has its cons, however; Sabine said she often had a problem with keeping her languages separate in French class, occasionally mixing up French and Creole (14, 17). “Modern Creole has a good chunk of derivation from French, so whenever I speak French, I struggle to not mess up the two, but sometimes I slip up and speak in Creole instead. Sometimes I don't even know until people in French class give me funny looks.” Sometimes, other classes like English or history would invoke a raised hand and a response in a non-English language. In her opinion, knowing multiple languages can actually make it harder to express ideas if you try to in a language no one else understands. However, when it comes to mixing, Sabine made sure to emphasize if she mixes English and Haitian Creole, it’s intentional (17). Combining her languages into “Freole” though sounds awful, a clunky combination of relaxed Creole and pretentious French that’s “not really a thing.” Sabine also said her dreams, 3 while usually in English, can be influenced by television or music in other languages, as well as that her parents almost always speak Creole in her dreams (15). The emotions associated with each language are also different, Sabine shared. She said she considers English to be her “natural state,” an everyday way for her to communicate and express her feelings (23). She’s comfortable with it, and her face clearly showed that English is an important, if monotonous, part of her life. French is almost always used in a professional setting, both more elegantly and more quietly (16, 23). She looks less enthusiastic talking about French, still interested in it but not necessarily excited about it. Haitian Creole is often used in a humorous way for Sabine, as she said she often uses it to make fun of people by muttering in a language she knows they won’t understand (16). She also described her use of Creole as more emotional, especially since it is often reserved to talking to her parents (23). She looks happier talking about Haitian Creole, perhaps even on the edge of laughing. I only ever speak to Sabine using English, so the idea that she might not “act” the same using other languages was a shock to me. If she were to speak French or Haitian Creole, her whole manner would shift to match. In the brief moments when I heard her speak Creole on the phone, I do vaguely remember a softness to her voice, and even her pitch shifting up. The language isn’t the same for her as English, and the whole air about her when she speaks it changes. Throughout the time I’ve known Sabine, she’s always talked about her ethnic and cultural background with pride; during our conversation, she connected these forms of identity with her linguistic identity. As a kid, she didn’t really like speaking multiple languages, as she felt she didn’t have anyone who identified with her culture outside of her family (19). She often feared judgement, especially regarding people putting her intelligence into question (19). Sabine said, “I remember feeling slightly ashamed whenever my parents would speak Creole with me in public or frustrated when they relied on me for help with English. I think it's really because of America's culture of ‘speak English or shut up’ and me coming to terms with my Haitian and American ideas.” Now, she considers language to be a big part of her culture. English connects her to American “culture” (she requested culture be put in quotes here, as she questions whether it is not a combining of cultures rather than one homogenous culture), Haitian Creole connects her to her family’s Haitian background, and French connects her to her French-Canadian family (20). Sabine loves feeling like a part of these different communities, and her language allows her to do so. When it comes to native speakers, Sabine said she feels like her American accent is 4 criticized in both Haitian Creole-speaking and French-speaking spheres (24). While only native speakers would notice the difference, she says it does cause people to treat her differently. Her family members from Haiti or Canada, for example, might call her out. On a more positive note, Sabine’s parents are her biggest encouragement in her multilingualism, as she says they wanted her to have multiple tools in her kit (25). They want the best for her, and so they push her to work on her languages and improve. When I asked if she had ever been treated negatively for her languages, she made sure to emphasize it was her race being criticized rather than her speaking of other language; the language just stresses the fact that she’s different. Sabine also said that there is far more good than bad that comes with being multilingual; for example, she’s much closer to her parents because she can connect with them in Haitian Creole (26). This is also a curse, she said jokingly, when she wants to ignore them. “I wish I couldn’t understand them because they’re getting on my nerves!” Her face softened and she laughed, love in her eyes. It almost made me a bit envious of that aspect of her relationship with her parents, as I could tell it really brought their family together. As for multilingualism in general, Sabine had a very relatable stance. She said, “It’s nice to know multiple languages because you can always one-up people. You know, I failed calculus, but I can speak three languages!” (26). I definitely feel one-upped. When asked about having a multilingual partner or child in the future, Sabine said she didn’t really consider it a pro or a con (28). She joked that she would try to teach her child multiple languages, but would probably give up if they couldn’t pick them up. As someone who would love to speak multiple languages, I was very interested in how Sabine feels about her current languages and if she’d like to learn more. “I love my languages, but I would love to learn an ancient language, too!” She suggested Greek, Latin, or Persian, as she wishes she could talk to people from the past and learn what their cultures were like (29). But, she said, she’s really just glad she knows English, Haitian Creole, and French. I left my interview feeling like I had really gotten to know more about my best friend. I had no idea how much being multilingual impacted Sabine’s life, having only seen the smallest of interactions with her languages. Outwardly, she could be mistaken for a monolingual speaker of only English; inwardly, her multilingualism makes up a huge portion of her identity. Watching her talk about each language, the tones and faces she used, was a very intimate and eye-opening experience. It was especially interesting as a monolingual person, as I don’t have any 5 experiences even close to what she has. I loved hearing her talk so enthusiastically about this side of her life, a side that I had never even considered. I feel so lucky that I had the chance to hear these things from her, and a little sad that I had never taken the time to learn them prior to this interview. I don’t get to see Sabine as often anymore, but now whenever I do I know I’ll listen with a different ear, one that knows the more personal side to her linguistic identity. From family to emotions to culture, Sabine’s multilingualism affects so much of her life, and I’m happy to say that she absolutely loves being multilingual.

Nozomi Park LING B101 Bilingualism Interview Language as a Complex Web Grace (1) [a pseudonym] is a 22-year old (2) senior at Bryn Mawr College. She was born into a biracial family, a Chinese mother and a Caucasian father, in Hong Kong where she lived her first 19 years before coming to study at Bryn Mawr College (3). Since her family spoke both Cantonese and English, Grace picked up both languages as a child (5). English continues to be the ‘agreed’ language to use at home (9). When she was 5-6 years old, Grace entered international school where classes were taught in English and she took classes to learn Mandarin. Coming to Bryn Mawr, Grace found herself using Mandarin more frequently with her friends (8). Although she believes that she is more fluent in English, the language used both at home and school (6), Grace also thinks her Mandarin has improved exponentially since coming to Bryn Mawr (7). Now, Grace speaks English, Cantonese, and Mandarin (4), with hopes to refine her Cantonese. There is more to a language than knowing its syntax and phonetics. Coming from a multilingual background, I believed every language contained culture and was largely central to the individual’s values and interests. However, the interview with my friend, Grace, expressed language as a more complex web of interactions with other aspects like history and social circles. Her interpretation of her languages inspired me to reflect on my own position as a multilingual speaker. Grace shared her historical knowledge of language in Hong Kong and China and her experience as a multilingual speaker of English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Her Multilingualism Through Historical Lens Grace acknowledged that she was able to learn three languages because she was raised in a biracial family and grew up in Hong Kong (10). English, Mandarin, and Cantonese are most commonly spoken in Hong Kong. Since I am a non-Chinese speaker, I had little knowledge of the Chinese language and thought there were few differences between Mandarin and Cantonese as dialects of the same language. It was very different from comparing English to Cantonese or Cantonese to other languages I was familiar with. However, listening to them side-by-side for the first time during the interview, I was surprised that even I detected the obvious differences between the two languages. Cantonese is the native language of Hong Kong because most southern regions of China spoke Cantonese while most northern regions of China spoke Mandarin. Wearing her historical lens, Grace explained that Hong Kong had used English since the region was colonized by Great Britain during the Opium Wars. In 1997, the region was 2 handed back to China and had to adopt China’s official language, Mandarin. After she referred to the official language, Grace let out a huge sigh and stated that “Cantonese could have become the official language of China”. According to Grace, when China was founded in 1949, it was determined that there needed to be an official language that could be used among the numerous languages used across different regions of China. Political leaders agreed that having an official language would make political, social, and economic communication from one side of the nation to another easier. They held a popular vote to determine which language would be the official language, which Grace mentioned, “changed everything” (11). By a small margin, Cantonese lost to Mandarin for official language of China. Grace had mentioned several reasons this changed history, but mainly, it isolated Hong Kong where Cantonese was the native language. Over time, Chinese educational reforms by the government, attempted to get rid of other Chinese languages by only teaching Mandarin at schools like the Mandarin classes at Grace’s international school (10). From her experience of Cantonese, it was only academically mentioned to teach a lesson and not to teach the language itself. Compared to Mandarin, fewer people use Cantonese. For Grace, the only opportunities to speak Cantonese became limited to colloquial uses such as ordering food in Hong Kong and speaking at home with her mother (12). Grace believes the history of her home country played a large role towards her multilingualism. She likes to consider Cantonese her heritage language, even though it is the native language of Hong Kong, because she never got to fully develop her Cantonese. By intensively learning English and Mandarin at international school (12), Grace felt she lost most of her Cantonese as she got older (11). Her parents pushed her to learn Mandarin because they only knew how to speak Cantonese and English, and have experienced the struggles of not knowing the official language. Grace recalled that she was initially disinterested in studying languages because she was pushed by her mother to pursue a native course in Mandarin (19). Grace laughed to herself as she referred to the course as a “disaster” because she entered the course as a child with only her familiarity of Cantonese. However, she was grateful because the encouragement from her parents helped her grow to become more language oriented and further pursue language education through high school and college. Now, Grace is a large advocate of bilingualism and multilingualism. She wants to strengthen her Cantonese (29) and wants her future partner and children to at least be bilingual (28). 3 The Contributing Social Circles: Community & Friendship Coming to Bryn Mawr College, Grace took advanced Chinese classes at University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College to strengthen her Mandarin. She wanted to take advantage of the academic opportunities to strengthen her Mandarin to be as fluent as her English. Now, Grace can fluently read, write, and speak both English and Mandarin (13). It helped her to know both languages because it filled up any holes from lack of Cantonese vocabulary and vice-versa (10). For example, Grace sometimes throws in some Cantonese when she speaks Mandarin with her friends. It is a skill that, according to Grace, ‘impresses’ everyone because Cantonese is much rarer nowadays (17). The greatest change Grace noticed was that she was able to think and speak in Mandarin, like English (14). When she speaks one of her three languages, she finds that she unconsciously has vocabulary words of her other languages pop up in her mind. However, she doesn’t do this for grammar because she believes Chinese grammar is not as rigid as English (17). For example, although and but cannot be used in the same sentence for English but it can for Mandarin. Grace noted that it would be weird to mix grammar especially since the sentence structure of English and Chinese are different. She described that when she needed to form complete, grammatical sentences in another language, she needed to “turn the other language grammar off” (14). Related to this, there are some words that are difficult to translate because one wouldn’t be able to express the meaning that they were looking for if they translated a word from English to Mandarin or vice-versa. An example that Grace gave was the word jiāyóu, which has the literal meaning “to add oil” and is often used to encourage your peers. She often uses it to her college friends who are about to take an exam or finish a paper. Essentially, it is an equivalent of the English You can do it!, but Grace explained that everything she wanted to express couldn’t be communicated through the English equivalent for jiāyóu (21). She exclaimed that all the hardships and hard work of the friend isn’t acknowledged by You can do it, as it is in jiāyóu. Grace compared usage of different languages to different modes of transportation: “Like different modes of transportation, you will take different vehicles depending on where you want to go and how you want to get there. You change mode of transportation to be more efficiently, comfortably, quickly, reliably. Language is the same. Some words make more sense to use than others” (12). 4 From my perspective, Grace’s Chinese friends contributed the most to her progress in Mandarin. This is not only because there were more opportunities for Grace to practice Mandarin outside of the classroom but it also gave her more freedom to express herself. She admitted that she probably sounded more rigid in Mandarin compared to her Cantonese and English because she knew more of Cantonese and English slang (23). Learning Mandarin in a classroom context, Grace knew more to write papers in Mandarin but never found actual uses for it until later. She talked about the “inside and outside of language” (12). The Mandarin she learned in the classroom was “inside the language”, academically-focused, and professional but “classroom language didn’t teach emotion” (16) or informal speech that was the “outside of language” like slang. She recalls that even with her friends, they used less Mandarin slang around her because they knew she didn’t know them. She noticed this as they talk about the innumerable types of slang and as she picked up less words that she was familiar with in their conversations. It seems that a lack of real-world experience with a language hinders fluency of words because it is more difficult to get words across. However, Grace reported that she has recently felt that she had exponentially improved using Mandarin to express herself more freely. She credits this to her Chinese friends, who she is able to practice her “outside of language” Mandarin with. Her Biracial, Multilingual Identity The encouragement and opportunities that Grace received from her family, community, and friends not only helped her strengthen her Mandarin but also maintained her pride in her Cantonese and celebrate its present scarcity. This was largely thanks to her home region, Hong Kong. Hong Kong appreciates multilingualism and welcomes mixed children who are often, biracial like Grace (18). In fact, according to Grace, everyone in Hong Kong generally speaks at least two languages, which are often Cantonese and English. Typically, finding jobs are difficult if one didn’t speak at least two languages, which further motivated Grace’s interests in multilingualism (18). Being raised in a place that celebrated cultural intermixing and being born into a biracial family, Grace embraces her identity (20) as mixed because she is part of both Eastern and Western culture. Through Grace’s story as a multilingual speaker, the most enduring lesson was the interaction of history and community with language. I was greatly surprised to receive a history lesson of Hong Kong and China during my interview. It taught me that the story behind every individual’s language is unique and complex with their own experiences and perceptions of how 5 they view their language. I thought that Grace’s experience with multilingualism, further complicated her language. Her passion for her languages’ history and living in her community, has helped Grace build her biracial, multilingual identity and further motivated Grace to preserve her ‘heritage language’ as an advocate for bilingualism and multilingualism. After the interview with Grace, I observed that studying a language beyond its culture or for personal interests, can develop a certain joy and passion for the language. I certainly felt this with Grace and her experience as a multilingual speaker.

Mira Yuan Linguistics 101 Professor Lillehaugen November 2017 Do I Have an Accent? Fariha Tamboli (1), 18 years old (2), is a college freshman who was born and raised near Princeton, New Jersey, though her family is from India (3). She primarily speaks two languages: English and Hindi. She also learned French starting in middle school, and is now learning Arabic (4). She learned Hindi and English at the same time as she grew up, and considers herself fluent in both, but feels more comfortable in English (6, 7). She uses English with friends and in educational settings (8). At home she uses Hindi to communicate with her family, and uses English only with her younger siblings and less fluent cousins (8, 9). “In the beginning of my freshman year, I had to ask the teacher a question, and the first thing the teacher said was, ‘Oh, you have an accent.’ That was a shock. He didn’t say it in a derogatory way—but he couldn’t figure out what kind of accent I had.” Fariha has never lived outside of America. In fact, she has only visited India once, over ten years ago. “I know when I speak Hindi I have an American accent, but it’s not heavy. But I thought I didn’t have an accent in English. Do I have an accent?” (27) Fariha grew up in an area of New Jersey that has one of the densest Indian immigrant populations in the country. Almost everyone she knew spoke at least a bit of Hindi, but even in this environment she hasn’t always been open about her bilingualism. “When I was younger, I wouldn’t speak in Hindi in front of people. I guess in a sense I was embarrassed that they would judge me for speaking it badly.” Now, she is proud of her second mother tongue. “[In high school] the tennis team overheard me talking to my mom in Hindi on the phone, and they were impressed by how well I spoke, even though most of them were also brown [Indian]. They told me I should host SAASA.” She is pleased as she recalls this memory. SAASA is the yearly Indian dance performance at the high school. It is organized and performed solely by students who are Indian and speak some amount of Hindi. Over time, Fariha’s Hindi has morphed from a reason for shame to a point of pride. (19, 26) 2 Fariha finds it harder to maintain her fluency in Hindi than in English. She can’t read or write Hindi, so Hindi is purely a form of verbal communication for her. “If I don’t see my family for a week, I notice talking [in Hindi] is harder.” (11) Probably, she speculates, she could get by speaking only Hindi for the rest of her life, but she prefers English. English is the language she thinks in, and she has more practice using English to clearly communicate, whether with friends or while writing essays for school (12, 14). In most situations, one language is sufficient, although of course there are things that don’t translate. “The literal translation [in Hindi] of ‘my friends and I are going to hang out,’ is ‘We are going to hang ourselves.’ So I have to say things like that in English.” (21) Because Fariha has little experience speaking colloquial Hindi, idioms and colloquialisms bleed from her English into her Hindi. However, besides the occasionally migratory phrase, there’s a clear division of where she uses each language: Hindi is for home, and English is for everything else (12, 17) She finds that there are also differences in how she behaves when she speaks her languages. In Hindi, there are two forms of “you”: an informal “you” that can be used to address friends and peers, and a formal “you” that is used to address elders and superiors. When she was younger, she found this lack of distinction uncomfortable. “[In English] my friends are ‘you’ but my teachers are also ‘you.’” Now she is accustomed to the lack of distinction, but when she speaks Hindi, she immediately starts subconsciously assessing the age of everyone around her. (22) Although Fariha likes being bilingual, she admits that there have been downsides to her experience. She is Muslim, and her pride in her Muslim identity is at odds with a basic desire to be safe and accepted among her peers. There are a few fundamental Arabic phrases that she incorporates into her vocabulary, such as peace be upon you, which is said during greetings or goodbyes. “Post 9/11 it's something we've been cautious about… In public, we either leave [the greeting] off, or we say it really quietly.” Even speaking Hindi can be risky. Outside of her home town, the stereotype persists that Middle Eastern-looking people who speak foreign languages are terrorists. (26, 27) 3 Bilingualism creates creates logistical problems and cultural divides even among Fariha’s family. Fariha’s younger siblings are less fluent in Hindi than she is. Her sister that is closest in age can understand and speak Hindi, but her younger two siblings can’t speak Hindi at all. “Being bilingual can be a mess. If I’m outside and I want to say something private or embarrassing to my mom, I switch [into Hindi]. But it’s kind of hard with my siblings [because they will answer in English]. I’ll be like, ‘Don’t say that out loud! It’s rude!’ But they don’t have any other way to communicate.” (12, 26) Fariha uses her language to connect with her cultural identity, and she is aware that her siblings don’t have that same connection to their heritage. Being bilingual is about being able to enjoy Bollywood movies, forming relationships with her extended family, and connecting with her culture (18). She worries that her siblings may be missing something fundamental because they don't speak Hindi. For Fariha, family and language are deeply intertwined. At family gatherings, those who don’t speak Hindi—family friends, less fluent cousins, or foreigners who married in—are left out. The exclusion isn’t purposeful. There’s simply a canyon the size of a language that separates those who speak Hindi from those who don’t. Language is both an effective way to connect with someone and an effective way to exclude someone. Fariha always makes an effort to chat with her white aunt and her less fluent cousins, because she knows what it feels like to be left out or judged on the basis of language (27). These experiences are part of why she would like a future partner and any future children to be able to speak both Hindi and English. “I want [my spouse] to be able to connect with my family, and I want to be able to connect with theirs… and I don’t want my kids to sound like this.” She imitates an exaggerated, stereotypical accent. “Ideally they wouldn’t have an accent at all, so they could switch more easily between cultures.” (28) The ability to switch between cultures and identities is valuable, and it is an ability that Fariha, with her not-quite-American accent, actively works on. She speaks with a rounding of the vowels, a rise and fall different from the Standard American English cadence; her consonants are slightly clipped. It’s not quite an Indian accent, not exactly an American accent, not an accent that is immediately obvious or easy to classify. “I’m okay with the idea that I have an accent. It’s something that makes me unique.”

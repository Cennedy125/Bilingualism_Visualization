Ling 101: Introduction to Linguisticst
The Nature of Multilingualism: 
Language, Culture, and Circumstantial Dependence in Bettina’s Eight Tongues
	For this assignment, I chose to interview Bettina Kibbelaar-Huber, a 56-year-old who is fluent in eight languages (4). These languages include: Swiss German, German, French, Italian, Spanish, English, Dutch, and Papiamento (4). I was extremely excited to find out that Bettina was willing to be interviewed for this project, as many of the languages she speaks are languages that I also speak, such as Italian, Spanish, and English. Bettina was born and grew up in Switzerland but currently resides in Curacao, a Dutch Caribbean island (3). She grew up speaking Swiss German, a specific dialect that is spoken in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, and at the age of seven learned German and French while attending elementary school. When she was in middle school at the age of twelve she learned English. At the age of fifteen, she lived in Italy and while living there, she learned Italian. Soon after, at eighteen years old she also learned Spanish. When she was thirty and met her husband she learned Dutch and Papiamento, which are two native languages primarily spoken in Curacao (5). When asked about her degree of fluency in these eight tongues, she boldly told me, “I am perfectly fluent in all eight of these languages.” (6) However, when discussing whether or not she felt that one of these eight languages was dominant over another, it brought about an interesting theme that seemed to reoccur throughout our conversation. 
	Bettina never considered one of her languages dominant and explained to me that it always depended on what part of her life she was using the language that determined which one was more dominant (7). At different stages of her life she would use one language more than another one but everything had to do with the specific given circumstances. For example, when Bettina was a student living in Italy, she found that if she was having a discussion with another Italian student then she would become more fluent in Italian during that specific moment. Additionally, she explained that the language she speaks depends completely on who is around her at a given time: “If my mom is talking to me then I subconsciously switch to the language that she is speaking to me in.” This idea that certain given circumstances shape the language that Bettina speaks is one that continued to arise throughout our interview. 
	Due to the fact that Bettina currently resides in Curacao, the use of her German, which is the language that she grew up speaking as a child, has been less present in her life (8). Despite this, she does make an effort to utilize all eight of the languages she knows all the time. This is because even if she isn’t actually speaking the language, then she makes sure it is still present in her life, as she will read a book in that language to compensate for the fact that she isn’t speaking it as much. 
	Bettina expressed to me that she clings most to the people that speak the same languages as her because she is able to share things with them and feels a cultural connection to them: “Language is not only expressing yourself, it is understanding culture.” Since Bettina moved around a lot throughout her life and lived in several different places, she found that she wanted to understand other people as well as their culture. The only way to do so was to be able to understand the language being spoken. When she was a child, she only spoke Swiss German, German, and French; however, when she moved to Italy, she spoke only Italian in her home (9). Now that she is living in Curacao, she is mostly speaking English and Dutch because that is what is spoken most frequently at her home: “Different places of living have created different circumstances for me and I’ve needed to adapt by learning the language that is spoken in order to be connected to the culture of that place.” (9)
	Two closely related questions, which I was interested in hearing Bettina’s responses to were: Do you think and dream in one of these eight languages more than the other? Since thinking and dreaming can very much coincide with each other, her response did not come as much of a surprise to me: “If I am thinking of an Italian person, then I dream in Italian; however, if I am thinking of let’s say, a German person, then I will dream in German.” (14/15) Once again, it is completely dependent on circumstances. Along with this answer, I was curious to hear about which language setting her phone is in, especially because she is able to read in all eight of these languages: “I have seven keyboards in my phone but for Swiss German I just use the regular German keyboard. My phone settings and computer are both in English because everything always comes with the English setting on it initially.” (13)
	Because Bettina is truly multilingual, I was even more intrigued to learn about her experience with different vocabularies in each language and if she ever confuses any of these languages. Bettina’s response was not a simple one, as she explained to me the ways in which her many languages tend to fuse together: “Certain vocabulary belongs to certain parts of my life. I do not really ever get confused between each language individually; however, there is definitely a lot of mixing between the languages, especially if I am talking to someone who also knows more than one of the languages that I know. Specifically when I was younger I remember Swiss-German, French and Italian were three of the languages that always tended to get mixed together. Even now, I will sometimes start one sentence in one language and then finish it in another.” (17) 
	Additionally, I wanted to ask Bettina about her mood in regards to the specific language that she speaks at a given time. I was thinking that because she knows eight languages, perhaps she associates each language with a different mood or uses one language more so when she is feeling a certain way. She explained to me that her Italian seems to be more prominent when she is feeling intense emotions of irritation or anger: “When I am driving and I get angry then I will say something in Italian but only if I am alone in the car. If I am not alone, then it always just depends on whom I am with. If I am at home and angry with my husband, then I will yell at him in Dutch so that he is able to understand me, as this is the language that we speak most often together.” (16) For Bettina, it seems as though the language that surfaces most in a particular moment always depends on the situation she is in. 
Because I also have studied Italian and know how Italian’s are very passionate when they speak, I wanted to have Bettina elaborate more about her behavior when she speaks the language and how that behavior may differentiate from that of another language. For instance, I told her that I know how Italian’s love to express themselves by using their hands when they speak. Bettina laughed and without much hesitation gave me the following response: “When I am speaking in Italian, I am much louder and this is because Italian’s speak louder and faster. The hand gestures when speaking are part of Italian culture and are normal; however, if I was speaking in English and using these same hand gestures it could be considered offensive.” (23) Bettina’s answer suggests that there is certainly a close relationship between language and one’s behavior which is also related to specific cultural differences. 
Finally, towards the end of our interview, I asked Bettina a very open-ended question: What does it mean to be multilingual and be fluent in all eight of these languages? Since understanding these languages has been equally pivotal for Bettina to understand specific cultures, she told me, “It has always been extremely important for me to be multilingual. I hate when I am watching a movie and I need to use subtitles because I can’t understand. I feel lost. I hate the feeling of not being able to understand what people are saying because then I feel disconnected to them. If I travel somewhere and I can’t understand the language, I feel inferior.” (18) Bettina’s response reveals just how crucial knowing these languages have been in order for her to be able to have an understanding about the people she is surrounded by. 
Bettina has mastered eight of the worlds’ languages and said that she had worked for a company at one point in her life that allowed her to use all of the languages all the time. She told me she feels blessed because she has the gift to know all of these languages: “People don’t believe it when I tell them I can speak eight languages. I’ve had people that are good in languages try to test me. For example, I had an interview once and they asked me to say something in every single language I know. Once I did it and they realized that I wasn’t exaggerating, they were very supportive.” (25) All of the languages that she speaks do have the same alphabet, which is why I chose to close our interview by asking her if she wish she knew another language with a different alphabet: “I love the sound of Arabic and was trying to learn it. I think I will learn Arabic first and then Russian after that.” (29) As Bettina reiterated to me, the more languages she knows, the more cultures she will be able to understand and connect to in her life. 

Rachael A. Bacchus Intro to Linguistics: Bilingual Interview Professor Lillehaugen Due: 16th , November 2017 Tinglish: The Story of Chayanit Chayanit “Jenny” Yung was the first person I had met on my first day of college (1). We lived two doors down, little did we know we would end up being really good friends. Currently at the age of 19, she had experiences that I could only imagine having (2). Her hometown being Bangkok, Thailand had always brought me to amazement because of my own nostalgic fascination with the island (3). My initial thought in choosing a person for this interview was quite simple, because I knew she would be perfect to talk to. She is an open book that is unfiltered and willing to share her personality freely. Jenny was born in Bangkok, Thailand, and at age 13 had moved to the United States to go to boarding school in Massachusetts. She started speaking at 3 years old, her parents both incorporated English and Thai into her speech at the same time (4, 5). “[Her] parents spoke both languages and thought it would be useful for their children to learn both. [She] was pretty fluent in both languages but writing in Thai [was] harder” (6). Her use of language just depended on her location. She stated that when she is “in the States [she is] more comfortable with English versus in Thailand the longer [she] stay[s] at home the more comfortable [she is] speaking it.” Due to boarding school, English had become the dominant language since it is used more often and she has an eight month stay within the States, making her speak more English (7, 8), on the contrary to speaking Thai, which is only used when she is home in Thailand. As our conversation continued to flow, she introduced me to a new term that I have never heard before. We had been talking about her use of language at home currently versus as a child, where she responded with the phrase Tinglish, a mix of Thai and English (9). She explained that as a child English was structured “weirdly” but now in Thai it is “harder to translate due to direct meaning and sentence structures being different.” It is interesting to see bilingual people 2 switching between two languages without having much thought about it being said. Being that she uses both languages in her home, the context in which she uses them are situational (12). For example, if she is with her family or sister in the U.S. she might speak Thai opposed to English. As she was describing this, it almost reminded me of code switching, where people can manipulate their language(s) depending on the situation; this manipulation can vary from tone to use of the language as well. Jenny’s use of her languages varies from time to time, when she reads it is mostly in English (13). I found it a little humorous when she said “Thai hurts my eyes” despite her impaired vision she told me it is quite a complicated language to read “because it is curvy and doesn’t have any spaces between words, nor does it use any punctuation.” We started talking about dreams, in which she responded that the dreams she remembers are mostly in Thai since it is not used as often which makes it more memorable to her (15). She only associated the language of Thai with Thailand. Whereas, for English it is universal, “it is the number one language that is hard to pinpoint a culture on it” (20). This is related to how she was perceived within schooling; she was always known as the Thai girl not someone who was bilingual (27). It had never been truly negative but the idea of associating the culture with someone based on appearance was not in her favor. Some advantages of being bilingual or multilingual can be the ability to have abundance in communication and understanding other people and cultures. This concept is similar Jenny’s ideology of being bilingual. To her being bilingual was that “it’s a leg up to speak two different languages and to learn three languages” (18). She provided an example of when she was learning a little bit of Japanese and now for her “learning Chinese is easier due to [her] previous background in languages.” You could hear it in her voice the willingness to learn new languages and making use of the already obtained ones to further communicate. Different languages also can be difficult to directly translate because sometimes in a language like Thai you may not have an English word for it or vice versa. She had used the term “transliterate” and defined it as a direct translation of what a word literally means opposed to the proper way to define a word with structure. With the examples provided in English she described words like “sexy”, “hotdog”, “pasta”, etc. (21) which in Thai would not directly 3 translate into a Thai sign, it would be said in English. This is where things got interesting because she introduced the use of Thai Sectors, in which you would use to almost dissect the language based on the audience you are speaking to. She broke it down into four categories: Friends, Elders, Royals, and Monks. “For friends, [she] would use street language which would contain slang and a very relaxed tone. For elders, [she] use elegant which would be more proper, for royals it is royal language/pronouns; for monks, it is religious.” This reminds me of a lot of cultures in which you would have to respect your elders and speak of a certain language when around them. However, she told me “[she] never really use the religious sector because [her] mother would usually speak to the monks.” The Thai sectors reminded me a lot of code switching because of the constant awareness of who you are talking to, so making sure you acknowledge the type of speech in that particular language. The languages can be a very performative act in a person’s everyday life. People can switch language so quickly based on certain emotions or even their language can affect the ways in which they act. For example, I remember when I went to see a suspenseful movie with Jenny and a couple other friends; I remember her sometimes speaking in Thai due to the emotion of fear and anxiety. This relationship between emotion and languages are more connected than I had originally thought. As previously stated, Jenny uses Thai when she is back home in Thailand which to her results in her being “less responsible, politer, using a baby voice especially with adults, and freezing when confronted with a problem.” The locations and language change results in her being more child-like since she spent most of her childhood in Thailand making her revert back to times like that even now. Conversely, in the U.S. she is “more independent, better at problem solving, and learned how to do things on my own” (22). Moreover, this shows that the location provides her the context in which language to use, which location also helped further decide the way she acts and emotionally feels. All things considered, Jenny had no choice but to learn both languages because her parents spoke both English and Thai. She does not feel special because most of the people she knows are bilingual (25). In fact, she feels a little bad because she doesn’t know more languages like her father who speaks multiple languages. However, she does in her future want a partner and/or children to “for sure” be bilingual “so they can be more understanding and worldly” (28). 4 For a lot of people it wasn’t for most a choice for them to learn two languages because being in the U.S. you would have to learn primarily in English and sometimes at home speak to your parents in another language. Jenny had made me understand more not just about her but about her culture. She was taught to utilize her languages to communicate and learn about other individuals through language. Her goal in life was to be a polyglot and with the intent of being worldly and understanding. Jenny has been constantly learning and growing her language knowledge. She is currently learning Chinese because her dad is Chinese and she took an interest because to her “China is the next big growing business.” She also mentioned that she would like to learn Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, American Sign Language, and surprisingly, Portuguese (29); “[she] just doesn’t know why [she’s] interested but it seems useful to know.” With her motivation and dedication to becoming knowledgeable about other cultures she is capable of learning any language she desires.
Miriam Bernstein LING 101 October 2017 Not Just Words Octavio (1) is 17 years old (2), and learned English when he moved from Guadalajara, Mexico to San Antonio, Texas in 2013 (3,5). He speaks Spanish at home and with his siblings, and primarily English outside of the home (4,9). Octavio feels that he is fluent in both languages, although he still struggles with English occasionally and considers Spanish to be his dominant language (6,7). Using both languages every day (8) and having access to both cultures is a part of Octavio’s identity. He feels that being bilingual has helped him in life, allowing him to learn more about the world and other people. When Octavio moved to San Antonio, he was a scrawny 12-year old who spoke only the very basic English he’d learned from an English class in Guadalajara. I remember sitting as a teaching assistant in his seventh grade class and watching the awkward scene unfold as the teacher tried to use what little Spanish skills she had to translate the class discussion for him. Although it was difficult for him, Octavio kept a smile on his face the whole time, participating to the best of his abilities. Since that seventh grade class I have seen Octavio learning English quickly and impressively. I’ve watched with pride as he gave eloquent speeches in front of large groups, and our many conversations have led to a close friendship. I wanted to interview Octavio because, while I do not speak Spanish (although I hope to one day), the heavily Spanish-speaking culture of San Antonio is very important to me. In San Antonio, about 40% of people speak Spanish in the home, and about half of the population is of Mexican or Tejano origin. Hearing mixing of languages, or use of “Spanglish” is very common, and some Spanish words are even part of the vocabulary of monolingual English-speakers in San Antonio, such as Fiesta, the week-long festival held every spring celebrating San Antonio and its culture. San Antonio’s special blend of Texas, Mexican, and Tejano culture is illustrated in the use of Spanish and Spanglish by everyone from children to government officials. Octavio speaks with a heavy accent, and it is sometimes difficult for people who have just met him to understand him. He speaks English naturally but makes frequent minor errors, mixing up the order or tenses of words. Learning English was difficult for Octavio at first, because he was simply thrown into it after moving to the United States (10). “I came to school and I didn’t know what was happening,” he remembers. However the existing bilingual culture was helpful to Octavio. “At the beginning I was insecure because I didn’t know anyone, but I met more people like me that was bilingual. There were people … from the Spanish community that helped me to understand English and helped me to … get to know how things work.” Octavio speaks exclusively Spanish in the home, and has since birth, and uses English at school and in most social contexts (12). Although he feels that he is fluent in both languages, he sometimes finds Spanish is more prominent in more formal or high-pressure situations. “Sometimes when I get nervous or I know I have to say something [in English], I try to translate the words that I’m going to say. But when I’m just speaking I just do it like normal, I don’t have to think about it.” (16). Octavio laughed when I asked what language he dreams in, but eventually concluded that it is usually Spanish (15). He thinks in both languages, sometimes consciously deciding which language to access, other times not thinking about it. The language Octavio uses affects his thought and behaviour because of the different contexts in which he uses the languages. “It’s how I think, how I say things, how I structure my words, how I structure my phrases … my personality changes depending on who I am talking with.” For Octavio, speaking Spanish is associated with comfort. “I feel more relaxed, it’s a more familiar environment… friends from Mexico share my culture.” He believes that the difference in languages is not just in words, but in thoughts as well, and he embraces this difference, saying he is able to channel who he wants to be and how he wants to act through the language that he uses. (12, 14, 22, 23). San Antonio’s embracing of Spanish allows Octavio to mix languages when speaking with friends or family members who also speak both Spanish and English. Sometimes he switches languages to better articulate a thought. If he doesn’t understand something or has trouble explaining in one language, he’s able to switch to the other. “Sometimes when I want to explain something … I try it in the other language. Maybe they can understand it and help me.” These switches occur equally in English and Spanish, as he sometimes finds that the language he is looking for is missing in either. Although Octavio doesn’t feel that he has lost fluency in Spanish, he does think he’s lost some vocabulary since learning English. “Sometimes I forget things in Spanish or sometimes I forget things in English”. (11,17). Octavio believes learning English in a community with less Spanish-speakers would have been more difficult, because he would have less people to help him with the transition between the two languages. Being bilingual has allowed Octavio to expand his perspective, and to have a duality of culture. Spanish and English represent different points of view to Octavio, and he thinks accessing both is important to his identity. “I have a Spanish side and an English side,” and both are equally a part of him. Using two languages allows him to have more knowledge about the world. He likes learning about words and where they come from, noting that sometimes the roots of words are the same in English and Spanish. Especially important, he thinks, is the knowledge his bilingualism gives him of different cultures and different people. “When I was in Mexico I had a different point of view and it was like just one side. And now that I have English I can see the points of view of other people and how they think.” Octavio believes there’s power in language to connect with all people and the way they see the world, and that everyone should try learning another language. “Try to see… get a different perspective, try to know more about different things.” He believes that learning English has helped him to develop his identity and to be more understanding and open minded, because he feels he is connecting with more people. He definitely sees a change in the way people connect to each other between the two languages. “I think it’s different in English.” “When you change things from language to language, things change.” Octavio believes he has learned to appreciate being bilingual over time. While at first being thrown into a new language was difficult, he began to see the world differently and saw this as a direct effect of his bilingualism. In addition to his use of two languages allowing him to think differently and affecting his own actions, it also helps him to see others differently. “You see things you didn’t see at first… [not] only one point of view or one thing.” Octavio has an appreciation for the differences in his English speaking friends and his Spanish speaking friends and family members. “What people say, how they act, it’s different. You start to catch more things, learn more things about people, and the language.” In his view, language does not only encompass the words people speak but the way they think and approach the world. Languages contain worlds of differences. “Not only because they are different words, but because they … come from different persons, come from different points of view.” (18, 19). Speaking both Spanish and English allows Octavio to hold on to both parts of his identity. He tries to speak Spanish as often as possible outside the home, not wanting to let go of it or lose fluency. “I know friends that lived in Mexico and their first language was Spanish, and [in other countries] they stopped speaking the language and they just forgot it totally and they just speak English now.” Octavio still speaks English with these friends, but he feels that losing one of his languages would be losing a part of himself. “It’s a part of who they were, and now they can’t communicate with some people because they don’t speak anymore that language.” Octavio plans to speak Spanish with his children, as well as English (28). He and his siblings speak Spanish to each other whenever they can. “Some people I have heard about start mixing up languages and start to get confused and don’t want to be bilingual.” Octavio believes that language makes up identity, and holding onto it is important. “You keep practicing the language that you know so that you don’t forget it. It’s still a part, it’s still there.” Like me, many people in San Antonio wish to build their Spanish skills, and often friends will ask Octavio to teach them Spanish words or speak to them in Spanish. He loves hearing requests like this, because he knows that people are trying to connect with him and his culture. Being bilingual helps Octavio to be able to bring understanding to others. “I feel good about it … I feel secure that I can teach more people about my language.” Not only does Octavio’s bilingualism allow him to connect with many people, but it also helps him to serve as a bridge and give other people access to new languages and cultures, and living in a city with such a vibrant culture gives Octavio plentiful opportunity to do so.

Maria Bohan Intro to Linguistics Prof. Lillehaugen 16 November 2017 Many Languages, Many Personalities: Conditions of a Multilingual Life Diana Musich (1), age 52 (2), was born in Manhattan in the city of New York. She grew up in Flushing, NY in the borough of Queens, NY, and currently lives in Highland Mills, NY, approximately two hours north of her urban roots (3). She speaks three languages completely fluently: Italian, English, and Spanish (4/6), which she started speaking from the ages of 2, 4, and 18, respectively (5). Though she can understand spoken Croatian, and can basically understand written French, she does not consider herself fluent in those languages. English is her most-used language (7), as she uses it daily for work (8), but she employs Spanish and Italian daily as well; the former to interpret documents for Spanish-speakers at her job and the latter to talk to her mother (8). Presently she speaks English and Italian at home (Italian more heavily when her mother is visiting); as a child she spoke only Italian at home (9). Employees in the human resources department choose their words very carefully (albeit too carefully for some). They are hyper-aware of the importance of language in communicating effectively and respectfully with a large group of people. Diana Musich, Director of Human Resources for a high-performing New York school district, then, knows the power of language--a fact also evidenced by her fluency in three languages and slight level of proficiency in two more. Diana’s multicultural childhood explains her multilingualism. Though her parents moved to the United States before she was born, they never forgot their ties to Italy. One summer, her father, who had been a captain in the Italian Merchant Marines, bought a sailboat in London and took the family on their first voyage from the British Isles all the way to the eastern coast of Italy. They replicated this three-month trip for many summers, and even decided to move to Rome when she was in second grade. Despite only a ten-month tenure in the city, her time there still brings a sparkle to her eye as she remembers the things any second grader would--“mini notebooks” for math problems, great lunches, and the different way Italians have for learning to write numbers. When she returns to Italy now, Diana says it takes her only a few minutes to get Bohan 2 back into the swing of thinking in and talking in Italian, and in doing as the locals do. She notes that in Italy, she has no problem with (and actually enjoys) haggling at markets in expressive Italian; in America, she has no desire to do such a thing. By using the language, Diana fits herself into the culture of the place where she is. Diana loves this aspect of being multilingual--that she is comfortable wherever she goes. She has no reservations about traveling, because “somebody has to know either English, Spanish, or Italian.” To her, being multilingual means that she can communicate anywhere (18). She says that there is “nothing bad” about knowing many languages. Not only is your cultural awareness increased, but your knowledge of every language you know is increased as you acquire new ones. You begin to be able to pick out the meaning of more words you’ve never seen before based on knowledge of similar-looking words in your other languages. Additionally, she says that learning about the ins and outs of Spanish grammar structures in order to teach it to students helped redefined her knowledge of English grammar (26). Diana has two adult daughters and two young grandchildren. Though she was never able to teach her daughters her languages, she would love for her grandchildren to be bilingual (28), and has started teaching the oldest one some Italian color words. She thinks “Spanish would be more helpful” as “they wouldn’t use Italian that much” out in the world. As a former language teacher, she firmly believes that the key to language proficiency is starting instruction early and often, and that everyone should know more ways to communicate. “Kids in Italy and Croatia start learning English very young, and are better at using it than some American kids are,” she noted. Though Diana says she does not behave differently when speaking her different languages (23), she notes that the common contexts in which she uses the languages have impacted her vocabulary. Since she uses most often uses Spanish in her current job to translate various school registration documents, Diana notes that her current Spanish vocabulary involves very technical medical and “academic, professional” terms that she would probably not have picked up if she was just a casual Spanish speaker. Diana’s Italian knowledge differs from other native speakers of the language. For one, she “knows less slang.” She traces this to her lack of exposure to Italian people besides her parents and her short stay in the country. She also said that her Italian feels like it is “stuck in a timewarp,” as she doesn’t know words for modern technology like computers, cell phones, etc. In that sense, she has lost fluency in the language, as she has not kept up with the changes it has undergone since she first learned it (11). While she correctly guessed that the word for Bohan 3 Facebook in Italian is just Facebook with Italian accent, she thinks she would find it hard keeping up with the younger, more technology-versed generation of today--as many older speakers of most languages do. Diana is most up-to-date on the inner workings of her dominant language, English, as she uses it everyday to communicate at her Human Resources job. Not surprisingly, she uses Spanish relatively often at work, too--she helps translate medical documents and other papers for registering families in the school district (12). The role of Spanish in Diana’s life has changed significantly since her first interactions with the language when she was 18, the age she first started learning it as a Spanish major in college. After graduating, she became a Spanish teacher, and for six years taught kindergarteners through ninth graders the language by aligning their Spanish knowledge with knowledge from other classes. In her words “if they were learning biomes in science class, I would teach them the same thing in Spanish.” She says that this was “the best job [she] had,” and she still tries to keep up with the daily, conversational Spanish she used in the classroom by watching Spanish television shows; however, she consumes media predominantly in English (13). While Spanish has changed somewhat for Diana, Italian is something she uses exclusively with family (12); thus, the language still feels more personal and less business-like. The only person she regularly speaks Italian with is her mother, though, so while she hears the language in their daily phone calls, she does not often hear the language among strangers out and about in their daily lives. She noted that this was probably because of the lack of Italian-speakers in her region. If she lived in Queens where her mother is still located, she would probably get more constant Italian exposure, as the population of Italians is much greater--there are even Italian news channels available. Because of the lack of Italian outside the confines of her phone, Diana “love[s] it when [she] hear[s] people speaking Italian.” She cites a recent experience at the Bronx Zoo, a tourist destination for individuals from all around the world: while looking at the giraffes, she heard a mother talking to her son about the animals in Italian, and thought, “this is so cool!” She felt the urge to “linger and chat with them.” She does not get as enthusiastic about hearing Spanish or English. This desire to connect with people is significant to Diana’s situation in life, as she noted at the end of the interview that she felt her job had generally made her more “introverted” among strangers. It seems ironic that an occupation involving constant human interaction could make one more inclined to stay within herself; however, it makes sense that so much talking to and worrying about other people’s feelings would make someone want to do the exact opposite Bohan 4 when she is off the clock. To Diana, her administrator side is slightly stifling--it must be carefully cultivated, as she is a representative of her school district. One word out of place could land the school in hot water. When she uses Italian, though, Diana says she is allowed to “just be herself” and say what she really thinks. She can also remember her enriching traveling childhood and the memories she made amongst her family. For her, being multilingual is not just an attractive quality to add to her resume--it presents her with the opportunity to be a “different person” for a moment and allows her to have new life experiences.
Fluency of Language, Fluency of Mind
By Sophie Brous

Jackson Jin (1) is a 19 year-old (2) native speaker of Chinese and English (4). Growing up in Shanghai, China (3), he spoke and was surrounded by Chinese--at home, in the classroom, and with his friends. At the age of 6, he began to study English in school (5) as part of the class curriculum (10). At first, Jackson “hated” English because it was a difficult language to learn. However, as he grew up, he began to appreciate his English knowledge more and more. 

	Before high school, Jackson never really thought much about his bilingualism. However, everything changed when he began the college application process. During this time he was forced to immerse himself in English to a much greater extent than he ever had before. He took the SAT and AP tests, which were all in English, and his college application essays and interviews were conducted in English. As a result, Jackson credits the college process for propelling him into full English fluency (19). At this point, Jackson considers himself entirely fluent in both Chinese and English (6).

	While Chinese was his dominant language growing up, Jackson finds it difficult to pinpoint which language he uses more now that he is a student at Haverford, and he no longer considers either language dominant (7). On campus, most of his daily life is conducted in English (8). He speaks in English with the majority of his friends, his classes are in English, and the environment around him is full of English (12). As a result, Jackson says he tends to think mostly in English when he is at Haverford. It is simply easiest for him to hold a conversation in English when he is thinking in English as well, and because he is surrounded by English, it makes his thought process more efficient to think in English (14). In fact, he told me that during our interview, he was thinking about his answers in English. On the other hand, his life would not be complete without a mix of both of his languages, and he feels most comfortable in a setting where he is able to use both languages rather than just one. Because of this, he hopes that his future family would be bilingual, as it would help him to feel more comfortable and connected with them (28). With the ability to use either of his languages with his family, the many nuanced differences in the ways in which Jackson uses English and Chinese would be communicable to them. Not only would he be able to use whichever language he felt like using in the moment, he would be able to teach his children the cultural importance of each language.

	Jackson’s language use is very situational. His family members speak some English, but their Chinese is much more fluent, so it is easier and more natural for them to communicate in Chinese (8,9). When he is home, Jackson thinks in both languages (14). He specifically thinks in Chinese when he is thinking about his parents, and when he plays basketball he always thinks in English terms (12). However, as he jokingly admits, when he is home “it’s summer, so I don’t think at all”. This split of English and Chinese is also true in his dreams, as he says all of his dreams contain a mix of the languages--he never dreams in just one (15). On the other hand, his media consumption is almost entirely in English. He watches TV, movies, and sports news in English, and he reads in English as well (13). This is not necessarily due to his linguistic preference--it is simply that he prefers shows that happen to be in English. He also finds that reading for pleasure in English allows him to practice for his academic readings, which is helpful for his performance in class. 

 There are many differences between Jackson’s Chinese and English use. While he does not generally behave differently while speaking Chinese or English (23), he finds himself to be much more talkative when he is speaking English. In Chinese, both his speech habits and thoughts are much more succinct (22). While this does not particularly affect what he says, Jackson tends to associate Chinese with stronger values and interpersonal relationships. Meanwhile, English to him is much more media-centric, as much of his English language knowledge stemmed from his interest in media and sports culture (20). In terms of speech, what he says is pretty much equivalent in each language, with one exception: cursing. Jackson says that, while his choice of language will be dependent on context in every other situation, cursing always feels most natural to him in Chinese (12), as he has been “cursing in Chinese for 19 years”, so it is more comfortable for him to express himself in the same way he always did growing up. Aside from cursing, emotion does not generally affect Jackson’s speech, as he claims he is “not a very emotional person” (16). 

While he is extremely fluent in both of his languages, Jackson occasionally makes errors. He often mixes up his languages, either intentionally or unintentionally. He says this is most likely to happen when speaking with his Chinese friends at Haverford. Many of his Chinese friends here are not at his extreme level of fluency in English, and therefore find it much easier and more comfortable to communicate in Chinese with each other. However, while Jackson is on campus and surrounded by English speakers, he finds himself in a much more English-oriented mindset. As a result, he will often struggle to speak Chinese here without inserting at least some English words into the conversation. At home, this is much less of an issue--he becomes re-immersed in Chinese culture and language, so he is able to revert entirely back into speaking Chinese with his family and friends (17). This transition can sometimes take some time, as he is changing from one linguistic environment to a completely different one, but he does not forget either of his languages--he simply must actively work to think and speak in each setting (11). Fortunately, he does not usually come across words that are different to translate in between languages. The only exception to this, he says, would be idioms--certain Chinese idioms may be difficult for him to explain in English due to their nuanced cultural connotations (21). For example, Jackson explains, “When you want to say that you’ve given all you have and you’ve used all your strength, you say “I’ve used the power of nine cows and two tigers”. While he was able to get across the basic meaning of this idiom, it is difficult for a non-Chinese speaker to understand its full scope.

In addition to his main languages, Jackson also studied German for a shorter period of time. In middle school, he had the choice between German and Japanese, and he chose German in order to challenge himself more. He studied German for 3 years and promptly forgot most of it by high school. In his first year at Haverford, he joined a German class, and he felt that relearning the language was much easier because he was able to apply the skills he used to learn English to his German learning process. While he still does not know much German, he believes that his bilingualism made German class--and would make learning a different language--a lot easier. He hopes to eventually learn Spanish, as it is a language that he feels would be very useful for him in his career and in general. (29) But for now, Chinese and English have been enough to get him far, and he could not imagine his life without being bilingual.

Jackson feels strongly that his bilingualism has been a very positive aspect of his life and his identity (18). He believes that bilingualism gives him a great advantage, crediting his language skills for making him wiser and exposing him to multiple viewpoints through the culturally different lenses of English and Chinese. Through his knowledge of both languages, he has been able to meet and engage with all kinds of people, and he is able to combine parts of each language in order to help him learn concepts and techniques. For example, when studying a new language, he can use mnemonic devices from both English and Chinese to doubly reinforce his knowledge of a word or phrase. Outside of the classroom, he says that his language skills make him feel more secure in travel. He knows he will always find a way to communicate with someone in any situation, whether he is ordering food in a restaurant, booking a hotel, or in an emergency situation. 

Jackson has never felt judged for his bilingualism or his language use, and in fact has felt the opposite of judgement (27). His high level of fluency allows him to pass for a native speaker of both languages (24). When he returns home from Haverford, he is sometimes told by his family members that he seems more like a Chinese-American than a Chinese person, but as it is a culture that he grew up in, he feels at home in China (25). While on campus, he often feels that he has an advantage over many other Chinese speakers because of his total fluency in English, and in general he looks at his bilingualism as a very helpful tool. Because he is able to communicate with so many different people from differing backgrounds and culture through fluent conversation, he can understand the world from many more viewpoints than a monolingual person could. This is especially important to him because he hopes to become a psychologist, and his language abilities allow him to better understand people’s problems. For Jackson, the only bad thing about bilingualism is, as he claims, “the more you understand, the more you don’t understand”.  As he moves further and further from monolingualism in his first language, the lines of meaning and cultural understanding between his two languages blur more and more. He can no longer relate to or understand the monolingual experience of many of his friends and family members. Fortunately, this isn’t truly a negative for Jackson, as bilingualism has been far more beneficial to him than detrimental. The many benefits of bilingualism have shaped him into the person he is today. In total, the experience of bilingualism is something Jackson would not trade for the world. 
Stevie Campos-Seligman Intro Linguistics Multilingualism Piece Brook Danielle Lillehaugen October 9, 2017 1 Lifestyle and Fandom - How One Nerd from Mexico Engages Multilingualism L is eighteen and from many places; Chihuahua Chihuahua, Mexico, Fort Worth, Texas, Wichita Falls, Texas, to name the main ones. Wichita Falls was the small town she first moved to, where she claims to have learned how to perfect a Texan accent. Fort Worth was her city life experience. Now a first year in Haverford College, L lives on campus. Back home, right now, is Fort Worth. L’s native language is Spanish, but she learned pretty early on English as a kid, and also considers herself a native English speaker. Since she hasn’t been in Spanish-speaking environments as much recently, she feels slightly less confident with her Spanish than she does with her English. Even so, of her two native languages, L wouldn’t say that one is more dominant than the other.L also considers herself pretty solid at Italian, which she started learning two years ago, and knows some beginning-level Lithuanian, which she also learned about two years ago. She’s currently in class learning Mandarin Chinese, but she doesn’t quite consider herself a speaker yet. According to her numerical calculations for her non-native languages, L reports that for “Italian, 100% on reading, 70% hearing, and 65% in speaking. And then Lithuanian, probably 25% reading and 3% speaking, 4% hearing, Chinese is like, 0%. L primarily speaks English, being often surrounded by dominantly English-speaking environments like Haverford College. She broke her usage of languages down for me as 75% English, 25% Spanish, and then an added 5% Italian. It should be noted that L is currently taking Mandarin and speaking it, but she doesn’t count her classes as really speaking. As such, L appears to be speaking languages over 105% percent of the time. She speaks pretty much only Spanish to her mother, not because her mother doesn’t speak English (she does), but because they both enjoy Stevie Campos-Seligman Intro Linguistics Multilingualism Piece Brook Danielle Lillehaugen October 9, 2017 2 speaking Spanish with each other. Her added 5% is lended to the times when she is speaking with her godfather, who speaks Italian. It was at this point, after being wowed by L’s multilingual abilities and interest, that it became abundantly clear that L is a big nerd when it comes to television. In relation to language, and why she learned each language, her obsession with the show Hannibal came to light: L: “English was imperative in the US, Spanish bc it was native. Lithuanian because Hannibal Lector is from Lithuania, and I like Hannibal Lector. Italian might’ve also been because Hannibal Lector speaks Italian. Italian was also bc my godfather speaks Italian. Mandarin Chinese was because my mom didn’t believe I could learn chinese and I wanted to prove her wrong. I was gonna learn Japanese, cause, again, Hannibal Lector (laughs), but instead I chose Chinese bc my mom challenged me.” While she had no choice in learning her native languages, L’s continuous adventures in language acquisition have come from a mix of family challenges and an interest in Hannibal Lector. (10) A lot of the languages she hopes to learn in the future also center around her interests in nerd culture and fandom, with the majority of the languages she wants to learn being languages that Hannibal Lector speaks - Japanese, French, Russian, and German. She also has an interest in learning Vulcan (as found on the show Star Trek) (29). A lot of her interest in learning languages also has to do with her involvement in fandom culture via fanfiction: apparently there is a large body of Hannibal fanfiction is in Italian (12) , and her ability to read in Italian has allowed her to read more, as well as translate some of her fic from English to Italian. As perhaps could be expected, given the amount she reads and writes fanfiction in a multilingual fashion, L reads about an equal amount of English, Spanish, and Italian. While she tends to have trouble finding a lot of physical books that aren’t in English, L has her ipad set to Italian and her phone set to English. (13) She recalled to me later that when she was younger, she didn’t know the shows Lazytown or Spongebob were originally made in English, as she grew up watching them with Spanish dubs. Stevie Campos-Seligman Intro Linguistics Multilingualism Piece Brook Danielle Lillehaugen October 9, 2017 3 While she reads a good amount in many languages, L noted that since she speaks Spanish and Italian a lot less of the time, she feels like she’s lost a bit of the two languages. Spanish falls more under a category of loss or lessening of confidence with the language, while Italian, as it was never native, has lost a portion of vocabulary and general understanding (11). She does speak Spanish with her mother, but the majority of her speaking situations are in English (12). Since she has a tendency towards speaking English these days, she has found that people tend to assume she’s a native English speaker, while less people have perceived her as a native Spanish speaker in recent times. (24) L: In Mexico they didn’t think I was a native [Spanish] speaker, but in America people think I’m a native [Spanish] speaker (laughs). Because the majority of US citizens that L interacts with don’t speak spanish natively, L’s native Spanish speaking is validated and held to a much higher regard in its perceived quality. Even though L speaks it less, she thinks of herself as more talkative, casual, and generally less awkward of a speaker in Spanish in comparison to English (23). Spanish also happens to be a common language L will slip into when she is upset (16). L is a big fan of multilingual abilities. She answered, without a pause, that if she were to have kids or a partner, she would want them to be multilingual. (28) L: (enthusiastically) I want them to speak languages I don’t know! Speaking multiple languages means connecting to more than one community. L noted how it can hinder some latinx people who don’t speak Spanish, in that it can be harder to connect to latinx and hispanic culture. Spanish means she can speak to member Stevie Campos-Seligman Intro Linguistics Multilingualism Piece Brook Danielle Lillehaugen October 9, 2017 4 of her family that don’t speak English (18), and of course, Italian means she can read Hannibal fanfiction from Italy. The sheer joy with which L engages in multilingualism is palpable. She mentions that it wasn’t always this way - she used to resent her ability to speak Spanish and English when she was younger, as she has an accent that is hard to distinguish. (19) She didn’t tell me what changed between then and now, but noted that she now feels incredibly positive about her multilingualism. Regardless of what axis of necessity or motivation, whether for survival in new spaces, proving her family wrong, or for replicating the knowledge of famous cannibals, L continues to explore many languages, and doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon.

Trista Cao Bilingualism Draft Ling 101 8th Oct 2017 Non-stopping Developer — My interview with Goose (pseudonym) Goose, my interviewee, came from Tianjin, a big northern city in China. I immediately thought of her when I saw this assignment because of the similar background we have. The interview began with us speaking formally in English. However, at some point, when she started telling her story, we naturally switched to Chinese. As soon as we started using Chinese, the conversation just became more relaxing and fluent. Goose is a French major in Bryn Mawr, but she thought it is the least fluent language among the three languages she knows. Her native language is Chinese. Besides that, she learnt the other two languages both in class. She began learning English at age four, and French the last year of her high school. Now she said she is fluent in English, while proficient in French. I am surprised by her continuous self-interest of learning languages, and thus, I decided to find out the reason for her passion in our interview. “My long journey of language learning started all because of my mom, who significantly valued the weight of my education,” said Goose. Her mother believed that a language is an essential tool that opens the door of a country, and this idea has also deeply influenced Goose. In order to allow her daughter to be exposed to English as early as possible, Goose’s mother put her into English classes at 4 years old. Nevertheless, in the first place, Goose had some emotional antipathy in learning English, because “teacher was always saying something beyond my ability”. She recalled that she had to memorise lists of special changes of past tense, which she had no clues about. Studying years and years without receiving any positive results led to a sense of loss for Goose. However, everything changed at the year of her 6th CAO 2 grade. Due to her years of study, Goose was able to rank at top one in her class for most of the English tests. From now on, her interest to English dramatically increased because of the feeling of satisfaction, and she started to proactively join extracurricular classes for English. Also, it is that time, Goose realised that learning language is a process of accumulation, and it took long time and effort to acquire a qualitative leap. In my perspective, I think this mental transformation is the resource of Goose’s patience and consistency for learning language now. In her high school senior year, she was no longer satisfied by only knowing English, and decided to learn more languages in order to improve her ability. Attracted by the romantic beauty of French, Goose went ahead to teach herself French. “When I was reading my 60 pages French reading for my seminar course, I was thinking that I must bumped my head when I decided to major French,” Goose said and laughed. Learning an nonnative language, especially when it is a completely different language from one’s native, can be exhausting. First thing she pointed out is the lacking of vocabulary. She wished that she could spend more time studying abroad or have more time to learn French, because the accumulation of vocabulary requires language environment and time. Without enough vocabulary, Goose felt a little impotent when she needs to use French. “Now I am using French instead of speaking French,” Goose stated. For example, when she speaks English, she can express her idea with appropriate words naturally. On the other hand, for her French, Goose has to search for words in certain meanings in order to express herself. She always had the feeling that “I know the word in English, and in Chinese, but…but… what is the French word!” She is mostly doing a translation work from English or Chinese to French whenever she uses French. In addition to the vocabulary problem, Goose rebelled at her stagy tone when she spoke English and French. “I cannot help but exaggerate my facial expression and body language so CAO 3 that people can understand me better.” However, she also stated that she tended not to be as stagy when she spoke French as using English. Goose mostly used French in her classes, with students who are not native French speakers either. When she saw their feigned tones, it reminded her to relax and try to be more natural. Nevertheless, when she spoke English with native speakers or French during her studying abroad time, she found herself being stagier than normal. In addition, since she were not familiar with people natural interaction in English or French, she disguised her timidity as politeness. She used phrases like: “Thank you”, “Sorry” all the times. Goose concluded that “I felt it was a fake me when I speak second languages with a native.” Other than all above, mixing different languages while speaking also perplexed Goose. Since there are phrases that are stated more precisely in one language than the other, she could not help but mixing all three languages together many times when she speaks. For instance, when she was telling her parents about her summer internship experience, she had to use the word “supervisor”, cause it was weird if she had to translate it into either “指导员” or “领导”, neither of which is appropriate. However, Goose explained that in China, people are inimical with others mixing English while they speaks Chinese. Some people think one speaking like this is trying to show off their fluency of English and their experience of studying abroad. Therefore, Goose has to be more careful in mixing languages when she was in China. Even though she faced many difficulties as being multilingual, when I asked her if she wants to learn more language, she said yes without hesitation. Other than English and French, Goose was preparing for learning Korean and Japanese as well. Studying Korean is for her love to Kpop music and Korean entertainment culture. She always watched Korean TV CAO 4 shows with me on the weekends. On the other hand, Goose wants to learn Japanese because she thinks Japanese is an easier language for her, who has Chinese background. Though it was hard to learn a new language and sometimes troubling to be a multilingual, Goose believes that language is a key factor to understand a different culture and to know people in that culture. Thus she wanted to learn more languages so that she can have more “keys” to other countries and their cultures. Though there are many impediments in learning languages, I can still see her passion in pursuing Korean and Japanese, and maybe more languages in the future.

Anya Capps Linguistics 101 Professor Lillehaugen 16 November 2017 “Juga, Marita!” Languages are present in every aspect of our lives, yet each individual has a unique experience with different languages. This holds true for my friend and teammate, Marita Ferreira. Through our discussion of her multilingual background, the challenges, funny anecdotes, drastic shifts, and new revelations that arose opened my eyes to new aspects of language. Marita (1) had never traveled to the United States before starting school this fall at Bryn Mawr College. Despite this, her English is phenomenal. Born in Asunción, Paraguay, and having lived there her whole life (3), Marita grew up learning and speaking three different languages: Guarani, Spanish, and English (4). Guarani is an indigenous language and also one of two official languages of Paraguay, the second being Spanish. Knowing that, I naturally assumed that Marita was fluent in Guarani, however, this is not the case. While everyone in Paraguay speaks Spanish, the levels of Guarani vary throughout the country. “I don’t know Guarani in comparison to other people [in Paraguay]. Like I barely know it.” She explained that she is able to communicate with people on a basic level in Guarani, but since she did not attend a school that focused heavily on the indigenous language and Guarani and Spanish are so different, she never became completely fluent (6). In spite of this, Marita does speak the indigenous language with her grandma, who lives in the countryside, rather than in the city. At home, with her family and friends, she speaks mainly Spanish, but also some Guarani (9). The mix of these two languages is called Jopara, which Marita described as the Spanish/Guarani version of “Spanglish” (17). This is most commonly used when there is a word or saying in one language that is difficult to express in the other. Since moving to the United States for college, she has struggled with finding a significant meaning in English for some Spanish words. I ran into Marita one day while she was carrying around a huge thermos and a cup with something that resembled loose leaf tea with a straw in it. When I asked her what it was, she said it was “mate”, a drink that is very common in Paraguay. She referred to 2 2 this exchange when I asked her about words or phrases that she could express in one language, but not another. “It’s tea, but it’s not tea…so how do you explain it to somebody that has never seen it?” (21). In high school, her classes were in both English and Spanish; she had only one class in Guarani. In fact, it was not until third grade that she began taking classes in Spanish and Guarani because prior to third grade, all of her classes were in English (5). Despite this, Marita still considers Spanish to be her dominant language (7). Now that she is studying at Bryn Mawr, she is constantly speaking in English; it was interesting to hear about the shift in the dominance of her languages. The most interesting part about the shift, perhaps, deals with the way Marita approaches academics. When she lived in Paraguay and took the majority of her classes in Spanish and always spoke in Spanish, she tended to think and take her notes in English. However, now that she is at Bryn Mawr, where she is surrounded by the English language, Marita “think[s] and [does] as many things as possible in Spanish.” It seems as though, because she is fluent in both languages, by flipping the way she speaks and thinks, it gives her mind a break (13,14). Interestingly enough, though, Marita dreams exclusively in Spanish and this has never changed. She told me a funny story that recently happened, where her roommate had accidentally woken her up, and Marita immediately said “¡Todavía tenemos tres minutos antes que suene la alarma!” (We still have three minutes before the alarm goes off!) She had woken up so suddenly that she did not have time to adjust her thinking from Spanish to English (15). Something that Marita was excited to talk about was the way her personality changes as she uses English and Spanish. “I am very mean, well not mean, but kind of more sarcastic in Spanish than I am in English. I sound more nice in English” (laughs). Because she grew up speaking Spanish in a more familiar and casual setting (with family and friends) and speaking English in a more academic setting, her personality and tone is different depending on which language she is using (23). As I spend more and more time Marita, however, I am noticing an increase in her sarcasm while speaking English; I would be interested in interviewing Marita again in a few years to see if this changes or flips even more as she continually uses English and Spanish in different settings at Bryn Mawr than she did in Paraguay. Through Marita’s multilingualism studies, she has been exposed to many cultures. I do not mean “culture” in the general sense of the term, but rather the culture of each language’s 3 3 structure, including accents and spelling, particularly those of English. For example, Marita took many English classes throughout her schooling and was taught by teachers from all over the world. When she was younger, the majority of her English teachers were from the United States or spoke American English. She also had teachers from South America and Canada for a couple of years, and for most of high school, she had teachers from England. She feels that by learning from teachers of different cultural backgrounds, she is easily exposed to their perspectives. “It was a mixture of all kinds of English, and I can say I have the culture of, maybe just American English and British English” (18). To this day, because Marita had studied British English for last few years, she writes with the British spellings of many words, such as “theatre” and “colour.” Of course, she also has both a Latin American and Paraguayan cultural background, as that is where she grew up. A huge part of why I wanted to interview Marita is because we play on the soccer team together, where everyone speaks in English. While Marita is fluent in the language and is very comfortable using it on a daily basis in classes and with friends, it is completely different when you are out on a soccer field with ten other girls, three coaches, and a sideline full of parents and students all yelling out different words and phrases. She explained to me, however, that understanding what people are saying is not the most difficult part. While this does provide an extra challenge, the hardest part for her is when technical terminology is involved. There are many things that she understands perfectly, but others that are more complicated. The most confusing thing for Marita is something that I never would have thought of: the use of the imperial system, rather than the metric system. “Every time when we are on the field y el coach dice (and the coach says) ‘18 yards’, I just stare at him like ‘what are you saying?’ One time I just looked at him and said, ‘I don’t speak yards.’” Language goes so much further than just the literal words. So, while yes, she understood and could translate the literal meaning of what the coach was saying, she had no idea what he meant. This was something that the team had overlooked because we had focused solely on literal translations. Many of the girls would say things like “derecha” and “izquierda” instead of “right” and “left”, which although had good intention, did nothing for Marita because these are words that she just knows! She appreciates what the girls are trying to do and laughed when I asked her about it. Our coach, too, has made many efforts with his limited knowledge of the Spanish language and they do not go unnoticed. “A mí me encanta. Es como una manera de que intenta 4 4 que fórmame una parte del equipo” (I love it. It’s like a way of trying to make me a part of the team). He often says words and short phrases in Spanish, many of which the team had not realized were incorrect. It is not that they are grammatically incorrect, but they were things that are said differently in Paraguay. For example, Marita told the coach that to say “play”, it is not “juega”, but rather “juga.” “Juega” is used in Spain, but not in Paraguay, so Marita taught him this. “He learned that and he was really excited about it. He later said ‘¡Juga, Marita!’

Kennedy Ellison 11/16/17 Abstract Hannah Kim (1), age 20 (2), was born in Abington, PA and for the most part grew up in Lancaster, PA. Hannah now lives in Bryn Mawr, PA (3) and is a student at Bryn Mawr College. She speaks Korean and English (4) with Korean as her first language and learned English at 4 years old (5). Hannah can hold conversations in both Korean and English, but says she is weaker in reading and writing in Korean (6). She says that English is her dominant language now and attributes that dominance to being at a college where she speaks English (7). She uses English with peers and at school and uses Korean with her parents or anyone she knows who can’t speak English who is Korean. She feels that she uses English more frequently now that she is in college and away from home (8). At home, Hannah speaks Korean with her parents or grandparents if they call, while using English with her siblings and this was still the case when Hannah was a child (9). 1 Using Language to Serve Others Hannah Kim and I originally bonded over our shared love of fruit. Further conversations caused us to become roommates, freshman year, and the rest is history. I remember hearing Hannah talk to her parents on the phone and telling me about her knowledge of Korean. I remember her teaching me the correct way of pronouncing her Korean name or the right way to say Lancaster. She is always helping other people to the best of her abilities. When asked to interview a person who identifies as bilingual, my mind immediately jumped to Hannah. Sitting down with her for the interview, I was excited to see what new things I would get to learn about her. As I listened to Hannah’s answers, it was interesting to see how the procurement of her languages was shaped by the help of others and how her desire to comfort and aid others manifests in her use of language, identity in language, experiences of language. The formation of Hannah’s languages was clearly shaped by the help of others, as is the case with most people. Hannah began by describing why she learned each of her languages. She learned Korean as her first language through her parents and learned English while staying with an American family at the age of four (10). It is would seem common that a person’s first language is learned from their family and that a person would associate their first language with comfort. What is more interesting is that Hannah’s family stayed with the American family while her father was in seminary for around 9 months. The American family aided Hannah’s family financially by providing housing which made Hannah’s experiences more comfortable and Hannah also began learning English from immersion in their home. In the present day, she notes that she feels like her Korean has gotten weaker since she came to Bryn Mawr College in 2015, though she has not lost the use of language completely (11). Hannah believes that it usually takes around a week at home to regain her fluency of Korean. Though Hannah’s level of fluency in Korean is not the same as when she first acquired it, the associations of comfort and help surrounding her use of language endures. For Hannah, the use of her languages varies depending on the context and her answers suggest that she errs towards making the person that she is communicating with more comfortable. Hannah uses English if she knows that a person can speak English and Korean if she knows that a Korean person is more comfortable speaking in Korean. For 2 example, she will automatically speak Korean to her parents and grandparents to simplify communication for them. Around peers, friends, and siblings, Hannah speaks English (12). Hannah consumes media in both English and Korean, depending on the context. She keeps her phone in English and primarily watches and listens to TV shows and music in English, but occasionally does so in Korean. She also follows some Korean social media accounts. However, Hannah primarily experiences media and entertainment in English (13). When it comes to how Hannah uses language in her thinking, Hannah believes that she thinks about her primary needs such as hunger, pain, and temperature, in Korean. She believes that this is because Korean was her first language and children tend to primarily communicate basic needs. Outside of basic needs, she thinks in English (14). After I inquire about the languages that she dreams in, Hannah laughs and says “I don’t remember most dreams!” Hannah clarifies by saying that when she does remember her dreams, the language she dreams in depends on the people involved. If her mother or another older relative is in the dream, then she will dream in Korean, otherwise she typically dreams in English (15). Even in her dreams, she will change her use of language to help other people and make them more comfortable. If Hannah is feeling extreme emotions like anger or sadness, then she says the language that surfaces depends on the person (16). Hannah gives the example of annoyance and jokingly says, “If I’m with my mom and I’m really really annoyed, then I’m annoyed in Korean.” If she is annoyed with a peer, then English would surface. Hannah bursts into laughter when I ask if she ever mixes her languages. She jokes that “Konglish” (a mix of Korean and English) is probably her primary language with her parents when she is being “lazy” in her communication (17). This is an example of Hannah focusing on using language in the most convenient way for her, which she labels as a “lazy”. This would suggest that she normally prioritizes the needs of other people instead of what is easiest for her needs. If she is not being “lazy”, she is using her bilingualism to assist others. As Hannah reflected on how being bilingual impacts her identity, she came to several conclusions. Being bilingual is a positive thing in Hannah’s eyes. She says that she identifies as Korean even though she was born in America. She is “Korean before 3 American” and says she identifies with her ethnicity (18). When it comes to culture, Hannah associates Korean culture with its food culture. Whereas with English, she laughed and said, “English culture is westernized?” but didn’t elaborate (20). Hannah believes that the Korean language has many more descriptive words than in English. She finds it more difficult to describe things like taste in English compared to Korean. Hannah believes it is easier for her to express feelings and describe ideas in Korean. She believes that there are descriptive words that exist in Korean that have no equivalent in English (21). Upon reflection, Hannah concluded that she behaves differently in her two languages. She tends to speak Korean to older people who she wants to respect by using the formal version of Korean. She notes that there are two versions of Korean, a formal and informal version. She primarily uses the formal version. English is most commonly used among her peers so Hannah uses English in a more informal way (23). Hannah’s use of the formal version of Korean for certain people seems to show a desire to be respectful which could be interpreted as another form of comfort. If it is culturally expected to use a formal form of a language in specific instances, it could make a person uncomfortable if that expectation is not met. In addition, Hannah was open to talking about her experiences of how others view her bilingualism. She believes most of her friends are bilingual, but that they think it is positive to be bilingual (25). When thinking about how her parent’s view her bilingualism, she laughed and said, “My parents say that my Korean sucks.” She counters this by saying other Korean speaking adults say her Korean is good, but that might be in comparison to the fact that many of their children do not speak any Korean at all. Hannah says that occasionally her mom acknowledges that her Korean is decent and Hannah, herself, believes that her Korean is not bad since she translates her dad’s sermons and for patients in hospitals. As a student planning to enter the world of medicine and healthcare, Hannah thought that translating in hospitals would be a way to gain experience and use her language to aid patients. Hannah found translation in the hospital to be difficult since she did not know certain medical terms, but she enjoyed serving other people and attempting to make them feel more comfortable while in the hospital. Hannah translated her father’s sermons because her church was made up of mainly Korean people, but some married couples had a primarily English speaking 4 spouse. She would translate the Korean sermons into English on paper and give the English translation to those who were more comfortable with the English language. Hannah believes that her use of language is strongly tied to serving others. Hannah imagines that her bilingualism is a mostly positive experience and opens doors for more opportunities. Hannah said that a bad element of being bilingual occurred when she was young, like in kindergarten and struggling to communicate with her English-speaking peers (26). She also believes that she has felt a little judged by others in the past due to her pronunciation of English words. When she was a child, she had speech therapy since she had difficulty pronouncing certain English words. Hannah feels that the pronunciation difficulties probably occurred since she learned primarily from the way her parents pronounced the English words. Hannah mentioned that her parents often confused the letter r with the letter l in English words and so she also struggled with that. However, overall her experiences have been mostly positive and the positive attitude towards bilingualism could come from her association between language and the positive emotion of comfort. Thinking towards the future, Hannah is certain that she wants her children and partner to be bilingual. She believes that bilingualism allows for new experiences. She does not care what other language her partner speaks, but she wants her children to be able to communicate with her parents as well as with her partner’s parents (28). Hannah loves languages and says “I wish I could speak every language (29).” I found that interesting and inquired why she feels that way. Hannah’s response was passionate, “I think it would open doors to just communicating and understanding people better.” Hannah says that this would significantly help her with her future career as a doctor. She believes multilingualism can contribute to the helpfulness of a doctor by building trust and establishing better communication. She wants to communicate with others to help them. Hannah uses her language to understand people and to contribute to their success by helping them and comforting them.


Mary Emma Hignite Linguistics 101 Professor Lillehaugen “Dance Away with the Language” For this project, I decided to interview my French professor, Bridgette Mahuzier, because I believed that her profession could give her a unique perspective on bilingualism and languages in general. One of the most memorable parts of the interview happened in the beginning, when we were going through demographic information. I asked her what languages she spoke, and she listed off Spanish and German, noting that she wasn’t fluent in either of them. She didn’t mention English, and after a beat I reminded her of it. After all, we were holding the interview in English. She laughed and said, “well, English, yes.” It wasn’t until a few questions later when I realized we’d both forgotten to mention French, her native language and the one that I talk to her in most often. After that moment in the interview, she talked almost exclusively about English and French, the languages she considers dominant. As the interview progressed, I became interested in the different themes that were repeating: the way she defines her bilingualism, the relationship between her languages, both their separation and mixing, the influence of her profession, and the way she described language itself. “I was… parachuted in Chapel Hill, North Carolina… and immediately I learned [English] so fast.” Professor Mahuzier’s definition of bilingualism centered around immersion. When I asked her what being bilingual meant in her life (question 18), she said that she wasn’t bilingual until she was 21 because she hadn’t been truly immersed in a foreign language before then. She’d lived in Germany, but it didn’t help her reach fluency because the people there spoke Brigitte Mahuzier is a 68-year-old French professor at Bryn Mawr College (question 1 and 2). She was born in Le Mans, France, grew up in Le Havre, Normandy, and is now living in Ardmore, PA (question 3). Her native language is French, and she also speaks English, Spanish, and German (question 4). She started speaking English at 11 years old, Spanish at 13, and German at 15 (question 5). She considers herself fluent in French and English, "not really fluent" in Spanish, and she can only read in German (question 6). She considers French her dominant language, with English a very close second (question 7). She uses French and English very often (question 8)- French most often in her profession and then English when interacting "outside" like when shopping. When she was growing up, French was the language spoken in her home. In her home now, she speaks both French and English. (question 9) 2 French with her instead of German. It wasn’t “until [she] was here in this country that [she] thought of [herself] as bilingual.” This stood out to me partially because immersion had already come up once, when I asked her how fluent she felt in each of her languages. While she doesn’t consider herself fluent in Spanish, she believes if she lived in Spain, she would “just speak fairly easily” because the language itself isn’t hard for her. It also reminded me of my past language teachers who always encouraged students who were in the position to immerse themselves in the language to do so. I’d like to see if this is something that comes up for all/most bilingual people, or if people who teach a language are more likely to emphasize immersion as the key to fluency. Geographic immersion in an English-speaking country wasn’t the only type of immersion that she mentioned—she also watches a lot of English tv. When I asked her what language she watches tv in (question 13), she answered, “Oh, always, English.” Professor Mahuzier considers French her dominant language, but with English as a very close second. These two dominant languages are largely separated into her life during and outside of work. Because she teaches French, she conducts class entirely in French, and she talks with her colleagues in French as well. (question 12). She also reads in French for her profession “almost exclusively.” (question 13) On the other hand, she says, “In the outside, with shopping, of course… I switch to English.” (question 12) While this might seem obvious, as I believe few cashiers here speak fluent French, she also switches to English when reading outside her professional work. She reads the NYT and other newspapers and articles in English (question 13); with regards to the language she uses, both her speaking and reading habits can be mostly divided between work and pleasure. This division isn’t all encompassing, though; she has French friends outside of work that she also speaks French with. The other main division between French and English was with regards to when she thinks in each language. (question 14) For this, the division was based on geography rather than other context: in France, she thinks in French, and in the United States, she thinks in English. Despite this context-based division, her languages are not kept completely separate from each other. When I asked her how often she uses each of her languages, she answered with a laugh, “Sometimes I don’t even know which language I’m speaking.” Of course after that, I had to ask her if she ever mixed her languages (question 17), which she answered very quickly: “Yeah, I do that I think very often… I’m not a purist in terms of language. I know a lot of 3 people, especially people like me, you know, expatriates, they really wanna keep the language pure and French and perfect and grammatical. But I love to not do that.” I had gone into the interview expecting her to be in favor of a pure French, as a French teacher, so this answer surprised me. I was also interested to hear about the influence of being an expatriate—I hadn’t considered that leaving your country could lead to a desire to keep the language “pure,” until she pointed out the different linguistic ideologies of her fellow expatriates. Not only did she have a different reaction than many in her situation, but she was aware of that difference. I got to witness first-hand some of the accidental mixing of languages, too. Fresh out of our French class, she answered some of my initial clarifying yes/no questions with “oui,” and later said English when she meant French, correcting herself with a little laugh and saying “see, I tend to mix the two.” With the accidental mixing of languages, though, she spoke more about German and English, which she tended to confuse with one another when she was learning them because of their similarities. I’ve already touched on one of the ways that being a French teacher influences her relationship with bilingualism in the division of her languages between her professional and personal life. Another possible connection was illustrated in her answer to whether or not there are words or phrases in one language that don’t exist in the other (question 21). In her response, she focused mostly on how the existence of these phrases impacts those who are learning a language, specifically her students. She emphasizes these differences in expressions to her students because it can be easy to simply translate an idiom word for word, which can lead to “sometimes entirely incomprehensible” statements. She then connected this difference between languages to another type of difference, in which different languages have words that sound the same but mean completely different things, which she sometimes calls “faux amis” or “false friends.” She points out these two differences as barriers to communication for those in the early stage of language learning, like her students, rather than for people already fluent in both languages, like her. Her thoughts about language aren’t restricted to her students, however; Professor Mahuzier is very introspective about the relationship between thought and language, in general and in her own life. Before I’d even asked what language she thought in—or finished with the demographics and nature of bilingualism portion—she posed the question of what language she 4 dreams in (question 15), saying “And one question is in which language do I dream… that’s when you can tell that you’re completely bilingual. That I don’t know.” Aside from saving me a question later, this spontaneous thought showed me that she thinks about her own relationship to her languages and the effects and signs of being bilingual. When I asked her whether she thinks differently in different languages (question 22), she thought about it for a minute before saying anything. Then, she turned the question back on me, asking, “do you always formulate your thoughts?... your inner thoughts, how does it work, really?” I didn’t have a good answer to that, though I tried to find one, and we both laughed at our inability to come up with anything. Finally, she said that she thinks “a lot of things we do also are without language, or with broken language or with… I don’t know, I’m not sure if it’s different.” This concept of broken language felt connected to her identity as someone who isn’t a linguistic purist, as she again acknowledged the different ways that languages exist in “imperfect” states, even in our thoughts. And, I enjoyed talking with her about the relationship between language and thought. We didn’t get into the theories of linguistic determinism and relativism, but maybe if we’d had more time we could’ve—I think she would make a good linguist. The way Professor Mahuzier describes language itself is very musical. One of the places this was illustrated is in her answer to whether there are any other languages she’d like to know (question 29). After her initial response— “Yes, millions.”—she said she’d like to learn Chinese because she’d like to train her ear with another completely different language to hear completely different sounds, noting correctly that there are many sounds that we don’t hear in the language(s) we speak. She compares these sounds music, saying “when we sing… there’s all these in between notes that we don’t hear.” Towards the end of the interview, I asked her for advice on learning another language, partly because of my interest in the influence that teaching French has on her thoughts, and partly because I want to be bilingual one day. She again emphasized immersion and brought up the grammar drills and other work that we do in French class in reaching fluency. Her advice, and her musical vision of language, can be captured by the final sentence of her answer: “I think maybe you can only get to that graceful part [if you do the hard, dedicated work]—after that you dance away with the language.”

Stephanie Histon November 16th, 2017 A Balance Between Inherent Differences Alfred Lee (1), is a 21 year old native of Los Angeles, California (2)(3). He describes himself as a fluent speaker of Korean and English, with some proficiency in Spanish (4)(6). Drawing from his earliest memories of childhood, Alfred recalls speaking only Korean with his family, later going on to learn English through a bilingual preschool program, and continuing to learn English throughout the rest of his early education (5). He addresses the frequency of use between his two languages, stating that English is the more dominant language in his life (7). To illustrate this point, Alfred uses English nearly all the time, while Korean is reserved for his family and relatives (8). Although Korean was the dominant language in his household when he was child, he now uses a mix of Korean and English at home (9). The experience of being bilingual comes with its own set of associations, meanings, and values that vary across the languages and cultures that comprise the individual’s spheres of existence. For Alfred Lee, this experience comes with the understanding that being bilingual has given him a perspective on several aspects of his life that he might not otherwise have developed. “I realized that languages are inherently different in their structures...and it causes you to think about things in a different way that you don’t even realize. I love being able to think about things differently as a result of the languages I speak,” he tells me as we delve together into the miasma of memories, emotions, and experiences that he associates with being bilingual (18). Although Alfred has now reached a point in his life where he feels confident in his own reasons for being bilingual, these developments took time. Alfred’s beginnings as a bilingual individual started in childhood, where he predominantly spoke Korean until the start of elementary school. “I learned Korean to communicate with my parents, but I learned English later for school reasons” (10). From the start, his heritage as a Korean person was linked directly to his use of the Korean language, an idea he carried with him as he began to learn English. He describes his parents as the major proponents in his life that propelled him to learn English. “I think my parents very much encouraged me to be bilingual. They would recommend me to speak English because I live here but would tell me, ‘don’t forget Korean because of your heritage’” (25). Similarly, he was encouraged by the parents of his friends to continue learning English while being mindful of his roots. “You can speak English well, but make sure not to forget about Korean,” he recalls being told as an adolescent by the parent of a friend. Surrounded by these positive attitudes, his dual use of English and Korean began to flourish. Throughout the interview, there was never a point where I heard him describe an instance wherein a family member expressed a negative attitude towards his language learning, although the pressure to retain his heritage was always there. Alfred’s use of Korean has been complex for more reasons than the pull between delving into another language and retaining his heritage. This complexity causes different behaviors to emerge when speaking Korean around his family and relatives than when he speaks (mostly) English at college (23). “There are a lot of structures in Korean that don’t exist in English. For example, you have these things called honorifics that you use, and you don’t call elders by their first names. It’s basically the same thing as “Mr.” or “Dr.” but with way more meanings and implications. It’s most evident when I’m talking to an adult, or someone older than me. I’ll have to really watch my tongue.” Alfred notes that this type of social politeness does not seem to exist in English, and it often affects the way he thinks about his interactions in Korean and English (22). “I think that you’re always trying to somehow please older people or make sure you don’t offend them, whereas I don’t think that’s that prevalent in English. I definitely associated speaking Korean with social hierarchies.” This type of structured thinking and tone differences between the two languages comes across to Alfred as “inherent differences”, creating a clear divide between his Korean and English use. Despite this difference, his ability to switch between social frameworks and states of mind appears sharpened after years of practice, and he associates little difficulty with these behaviors. Even though Alfred considers himself a native speaker of both English and Korean, and is able to navigate the social nuances of both languages, people do not seem to view him as a native speaker of either, albeit for presumably different reasons (24). “In English it’s harder because...I don’t look like the average American. So I think initially, they automatically assume I’m not a native English speaker until they have an interaction with me. In terms of Korean, I do have an accent because I speak English more often, so I’m not really treated like a native by either side.” While neither side seems to see him as a native speaker, Korean natives seem more accommodating of this perceived lack of fluency. “If they notice, when I’m speaking in Korean, that I’m maybe not 100% fluent, they’ll start talking in ‘baby words’, almost to make sure that they’re more accommodating”. From his description, it appears that many of the people Alfred interacts with have a linguistic ideology about what Korean “should” sound like, or what English speakers “should” look like. Despite these misconceptions, Alfred seems to take it in stride, reiterating the fact that he believes in his own fluency within both languages. “It was mostly strangers that made these assumptions, or classmates in elementary school. I still consider myself pretty fluent.” While Alfred has perceived many differences in others’ reactions to his use of English and Korean, he made a clear note during the interview of the many internal differences between the two languages, and how they have affected his experiences. In particular, the use of English and Korean for expressing feelings and ideas has created a unique set of obstacles for Alfred. “There are a lot of emotion-based words or idiomatic phrases in Korean that I never really grew up being able to explain to American English speakers because I only experienced them at home” (21). This translation barrier also persists in Alfred’s communications with his parents: “I find it very hard to translate from English to Korean. If I don’t know the vocab in Korean, it’s hard to describe to my parents because they don’t speak English that well.” When asked how this affects his conversation at home, Alfred notes a few topics that he has struggled to translate to his parents. “It’s hard to talk about things like social justice, or racism, because there’s not really like a direct translation for those concepts into Korean. It definitely changes some of the things I talk about with my parents.” After a brief pause, Alfred switches back to how he expresses his emotions using the two languages, explaining he can “describe what he is feeling better in English, as long as it doesn’t deal with a specific Korean word or phrase.” Although the differences between Korean and English create situations in which Alfred finds difficulty expressing ideas to either his English-speaking peers or his Korean-speaking family, he seems to find a blend of both languages in some of the more casual spheres of his life. “I read in English because of school, and English is the setting for my phone, but I watch movies and TV shows in English and Korean. It’s very balanced” (13). He also finds himself dreaming in English and Korean, although his Korean-speaking dreams are less frequent these days (15). “I dream in both, but English is definitely more common when I dream. But I’ve definitely had dreams in Korean.” Throughout all of his experiences, Alfred seems to have reached a clarity about what it means to speak both English and Korean, and how this has affected his cultural identity. “I think I grew up a lot, most of my life, rejecting [Korean] culture, just ‘cause I grew up so much in this American environment. And I think it’s only recently that I’ve started realizing that being able to speak Korean kind of, I guess, is a way for me to accept my own heritage” (19). His admittance of rejection is simultaneously surprising and understandable. In his early education, it is possible that Korean took a backseat to his English use; perhaps as his fluency increased in English, Alfred was faced with the choice to respect his family’s wishes to retain his heritage, or to continue distancing himself from his roots through the use of English and the absorption of American culture. He seems to have a newfound understanding of the delicate balances between his two cultures, and has found a way to navigate them both. He plans to encourage his children to speak multiple languages, citing his recent acceptance of Korean culture as the driving force of this goal. Although Alfred was supported in early life by his family and friends, his attempts to find a balance between Korean and English seemed difficult, as English slowly became a more predominant language into his life due to the majority of his social environments. This asymmetry in socialization, combined with societal perceptions of how speakers of a particular language should speak or behave, may have created an early obstacle to the creation of the “balanced” bilingual identity he strives to have. The idea of a potential barrier formed by social contexts seems plausible since Alfred’s struggle to fully accept his Korean roots persisted despite his family’s warm encouragement. Alfred has come far in this bilingual and bicultural journey; he speaks from a grounded perspective, having thoroughly reflected on issues of translational barriers, the expansion of his worldviews, the social differences associated with Korean and English, and working to achieve balance between the two languages that help comprise his identity.

Yiyun Hua Ling 101 Introduction to Linguistics Professor Lillehaugen November 2017 Your English is so good! Megan, age 20, was born in Beijing, where she lived until she went to America for high school. (3) She is a multilingual speaker of Chinese, English, and Spanish. (4) She describes herself as fluent in Chinese and English, and almost fluent in Spanish. (6) She has spoken Chinese as her native language for all 20 years of her life. (2) She started learning English at 6 because English was required in elementary schools in China. At 15, she started learning some Spanish grammar in China and continued learning Spanish in high school. Surprisingly, she studied Spanish neither because she was interested in Spanish culture, nor because she thought studying Spanish would be interesting. In order to fulfill the second language requirement in high school, she chose Spanish because she thought it would be very useful in America. (5) (10) “Your English is so good!” You may have heard or even said this sentence before. When hearing such a sentence, what is your feeling? Do you consider it as a compliment, or not? Megan told me about her own feelings when I asked her if she had been treated differently because of her accents. She received praise on both her English accent and Spanish accent, but she did not appear very happy about those compliments. “I’ve been told many times that ‘Your English is so good.’; I was always like ‘Oh…Thank you?’ because I just don't know how to reply.” She continued, “I’ve been learning English for over 10 years. Having an accent like native speakers is really not a thing that needs to be complimented.” I understand her feelings as a foreign language learner. Most language learners’ ultimate goal is to have accents close to native speakers, not only because this makes them feel closer to the language they learn but also because they do not want to be discriminated with their accents. It is interesting that among all the English learners whose native language is not English, Asian people seem to receive the most judgements by native speakers. While British or French accents sound romantic or nice, Asian accents are perceived as strange. Megan also mentioned that sometimes she felt her accent was not so wonderful when she was complimented. It is because of her Asian face that people lower the standards of accent. The stereotype that Asian people are thought to have strange accents makes her upset. For me, words like “Your English is so good” do not appear 2 as a positive comment; instead, those words make me feel like being judged as if I am not expected to have an authentic accent other than strange Asian accents. (18) (25) (26) (27) Although Megan is not perceived as having an accent when speaking either one of her languages, she said it’s hard to decide which one of her languages is dominant since the use of Chinese and English are almost equal in her life. (7) Within her family, Megan only uses Chinese because her parents only speak Chinese. (9) Being a multilingual person herself, she expressed her wish that her partner and children are bilingual, or even multilingual. “Learning more languages allow you to know more countries’ culture and respect those culture. It is also an advantage that you can feel the convenience with more languages.” (29) Besides speaking Chinese when talking to her family, Megan also speaks Chinese when she talks to Chinese friends or people who speak Chinese. During classes or talking with non-Chinese friends, she speaks English. She is certain that Spanish is not the dominant one as she thinks her Spanish is not as proficient as her English. She ascribed only 10% of her language use to Spanish. When she is taking Spanish classes, talking to her Spanish professor, or chatting with her friends who she met during the summer program that she studied Spanish, she speaks Spanish. (8) (12) Since she uses each of her languages in a regular pattern, she thinks she hasn't lost the use or fluency in any of them. (11) Mastering three languages with high proficiency allows Megan to think in different perspectives with interconnections among the three languages. For Megan, the language in which she thinks is based on what language she is speaking, while she also said when thinking in one language, there would be a shift forth and back in her way of thinking. Her way of thinking in one language is also affected by another language to some extent. Days before, when she was writing an English paper, many of the expressions or sentences are constructed in Spanish way of thinking. “I did not realize until I read through the paper and found out that some expressions did not make sense in English at all!” For most of the time, she thinks, reads, watches TV in Chinese and English. Recently she has gotten more interest in Spanish soup opera, which I think is mainly motivated by her increasing love for Spanish. Many stories I can think about her are related to Spanish. I remembered when we were talking about the rr in Spanish, she showed me her skill that she could use the vibration of her tongue to sing a song. I also remembered that she uttered some Spanish words when she was sleeping. She told me that since she began to learn Spanish at 15, her friends kept saying that she dreamed in Spanish because she always said Spanish sentences or words during sleep. However, she has no memory of dreaming in Spanish during these years. It is interesting that she can dream in English when she feels that it has been a long time that she has not dreamed in English. When 3 she gets very angry or sad, she likes to express those feelings in Chinese, which is the same for me. Sometimes she will also scold people loudly in English or Spanish, but she cannot feel the same feeling when she scolds loudly in Chinese. When she is very upset, she will write diary in Spanish. She has the habit of keeping a diary in Spanish since she took the summer program in Middlebury where there is a language pledge. From time to time, when she speaks Chinese, she will replace some words in English. She seldom replaces words in Spanish because most of her friends cannot understand. This happened when we were doing the interview. Since we both speak Chinese, the interview was mainly done in Chinese with a mix of some English words or sentences. (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) Since the interview was done mostly in Chinese, when writing this interview, I found it difficult to go from Chinese to English because sometimes I am not sure if I express my ideas clearly. While there might be some difficulties with the presence of bilingualism, being multilingual brings Megan convenience and confidence. I saw the joy on her face when she expressed her feeling that she realized she could learn Spanish so well and have little difficulty communicating with native speakers. She was encouraged by many people to try more languages because they thought she might have talents in learning languages. Although being multilingual brings Megan good things such as convenience in communication, she also has unpleasant experiences. As she studies more Spanish, she gets to know more about Latin American culture. One thing that distresses her is the much emphasis on males in Latin American culture. She also said that when she spoke fluent Spanish, people always got very surprised that she could speak Spanish, and even so well. “I know, people just think ‘wow you are Asian how can you speak Spanish and so well’?” Most of the time, people simply judge her by her Asian face that she does not have the ability to master languages like Spanish, that Spanish is not appropriate for Asian people. Megan added, “I often had people ask me ‘Why did you learn Spanish instead of other languages?’, but it’s my freedom to choose what language I want to learn…And see, I can learn it well!” In my eyes, what I see is a Chinese girl’s with great perseverance in learning Spanish no matter doubted or judged by other people. Last semester she took a 360° course examined migration in different national contexts, and she was the only international student in that class. I can still recall how she struggled with her 8-page Spanish paper during final week. I also remember that she expressed her regret to me that when doing in-class Spanish discussions, she felt not so related to the discussions listening to her classmates talking about their family stories about migration. But during the whole semester’s classes, she always strived to 4 participate in the discussions and try to understand more. Seeing her work at the exhibition for the class at the end of last semester, I knew she never gave up trying hard. Several weeks ago, she declared a major in Spanish. Now she is working as a Spanish tutor. I believe being multilingual gives her power to continue insisting on her belief, and exploring deeper aspects of the world. 

LING 101 Blossom Jeong At the Threshold Cindy (1), twenty-one (2), was born in Shanghai, China and lived there until she left to study in Pennsylvania, United States at the age of fourteen (3). With Mandarin Chinese as her mother tongue, Cindy started learning English in kindergarten at a bilingual school (4,5). Currently Cindy feels 95% fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and 85% fluent in English (6), and regards Mandarin Chinese as the dominant language (7). She speaks Mandarin Chinese at home with her family, who still live in Shanghai (9). But Cindy uses English and Mandarin Chinese in equal proportions in her daily life (8), due to the fact that she is studying in the United States but still has a lot of Chinese friends around her. Though Cindy does not feel fully immersed in the American culture (that is in association with English), Cindy seems to view English as an important part of her identity. It seems that Cindy is at a threshold between Mandarin Chinese and English, the former connecting her back to Chinese culture and the latter offering the possibility of a second home. “We learned apples, bananas, but that’s it. Nothing serious,” remarks Cindy on her experience of learning English in kindergarten. Despite her early contact with the language, Cindy feels that her official English learning started mostly in primary school (5). To Cindy, fluency means being able to communicate in that language without the need of a translator. When asked why she views herself only 85% fluent in English, she answers, “There are still fields I was never in, so I don’t know words for those (6).” Having been in contact with English for a long time, Cindy traces her reason for having acquired the English language as “a requirement at school (10).” When asked which language she usually thinks in, Cindy replies that it really depends on what she is thinking about (14). For things that are school-related or things that she learned here in the United States, she will think in English, but this is because she does not know the concepts or terms in Mandarin Chinese. The same logic applies to things outside of school. She gives an example of having to deal with her phone account only in the United States, “I don’t deal with it in China, so I don’t know the specific words for it in Chinese.” Because Cindy has no terms for these concepts in Mandarin Chinese, Cindy tends to think of them only in English. But Cindy also adds that most of her thoughts are probably in Mandarin Chinese with some English words in them (to substitute for terms unfamiliar to her in Mandarin Chinese). Though the language of her thoughts depends on the situation, Cindy says that she does not really think differently in Mandarin Chinese and English (22). Also, Cindy feels that 2 there is no significant difference in her behavior when she uses Mandarin Chinese or English, commenting, “I just behave differently when I’m with different people (23).” So Cindy attributes the differences in her behavior to the situation, not the choice of language. Cindy offers several interesting aspects of her usage of the two languages. It does not happen very often, but whenever she is emotionally aroused, Cindy usually speaks Mandarin Chinese (16). Interestingly, Cindy adds, “I feel like my English gets better when I’m mad or when I need to get something out.” It seems that situations that pressure Cindy emotionally actually helps the usage of her second language, English, become smoother. When she encounters someone who speaks both Mandarin Chinese and English, Cindy will speak whatever language they are more comfortable with (12). For Cindy, speaking in Mandarin Chinese is preferable if the person is Chinese (here she makes a distinction between “Chinese” Chinese and Chinese American). But whenever there is at least one person in the group who does not speak Mandarin Chinese, then she chooses to speak English. When asked whether she sometimes mixes languages on purpose, Cindy answers yes, that “sometimes you just can’t think of the word.” On the other hand, Cindy feels that she rarely mixes languages by accident (17). But she adds, “It slips out sometimes.” She gives an example of switching from talking to her dorm neighbors (who are all from China) in Mandarin Chinese to talking to me (a nonChinese) in English. “Say I was talking to my neighbors. And then you come. I guess it’s my brain that’s slow on switching, and [I] say something in [Mandarin] Chinese to you. But then I’ll quickly realize, oh no.” Though there are occasions when she mixes languages by accident, Cindy is very aware of her usage of languages and quickly catches her mistake. While transition between the two languages is not very difficult, Cindy notes that the acquisition of English has influenced her use of Mandarin Chinese. Although she continues to use Mandarin Chinese in her daily life, Cindy feels that she has to some extent lost the use of Mandarin Chinese. She sometimes forgets how to write some Chinese characters and how to say certain words (11). She finds the cause in the frequency of her usage of Mandarin Chinese. She comments, “I don’t use [Mandarin] Chinese as often as I used to.” Reflecting on her usage of the two languages, Cindy thinks that different nuances exist in each language even if the expressions appear to have the same meaning. She gives the example of the English expression sorry and the Mandarin Chinese expression dui bu qi (which would translate into sorry in English). Cindy comments that “It’s not easy for me to say dui bu qi, but I can say sorry any time. Or it might be the difference between [the expression] sorry 3 and an apology. It’s just the culture and environment here that you can say sorry and it won’t be a great deal. But dui bu qi, I feel is more serious, and it’s a big deal.” She mentions culture again when talking about the difference between the English expression I love you and the Mandarin Chinese expression wo ai ni – which are also equal in meaning at the surface level. “I love you would be easier to say. Because in this [American] culture, everyone says I love you to everyone. But you don’t say wo ai ni to everyone.” Hence, the culture associated with the language impacts how she uses certain phrases in each language. When asked what role each language plays in her identity, Cindy answers that it influences what kind of people she interacts with. She feels that “what we can talk about affects the relationships.” She believes that there are some things she would only talk to people in Mandarin Chinese about. She gives an example, “If there’s something happening in China, and only Chinese people know about it, I’m only going to talk to them about this. Not say, Americans and other non-Chinese. They wouldn’t know what I’m talking about. Language is part of your culture.” Cindy makes a distinction between Mandarin Chinese and English when talking about this kind of issues, commenting, “It would just be an event if I speak in English. Non-Chinese won’t get the connections or the context or other things that’s related to the event or what it means to us. It’s something only the Chinese see as very important… And sometimes you just can’t explain everything. Because some things you just feel you can’t explain in words.” But it seems that speaking the language alone is not sufficient to talk about certain issues. She adds that it would not be the same talking to a foreigner fluent in Chinese, “Say you’ve only learned Chinese in American schools, but you’ve never spent long enough time in China. You don’t get this culture entirely. You don’t get it when you’re not in it.” Though language and culture are closely tied together, Cindy makes a distinction between learning the language and being immersed into the culture associated with the language. While it is necessary to be fluent in a language to talk about the related culture, being fluent in the language does not guarantee that the speaker is truly connected to the culture. Cindy also talks about how she feels about American culture. She admits that she does not really understand the American pop culture, explaining, “Because I don’t care about it. It’s not matter of fluency but… I guess it’s the same for native speakers and non-native speakers. You don’t pay attention to certain things, so you don’t know it. Language is part of culture, but it can’t represent culture. Even though, say you know English, you can’t say because I know English, I know American culture.” She also mentions that she associates Chinese culture with 4 Mandarin Chinese, but she feels distant from the American culture related to English (20). She elaborates, “I’ve spent almost half of my life in English and in the United States, I feel like this could also be my second home. But it’s still another country for me. Maybe if I stay longer, I’ll feel less distance.” Though Cindy feels less connection to the American culture, she still enjoys watching some American TV shows, commenting that “it all depends on what’s fun.” On the other hand, Cindy reads for fun only in Mandarin Chinese – she never reads novels in English, even though her phone setting is in English (13). Cindy explains the difference further, “When I’m reading Chinese novels, I can maybe do it even when I’m not 100% focused, and I get it. But then, for English, I still need to concentrate to be able to picture what it’s describing or saying in my head.” Since she has a visual aid for TV, she can watch TV both in English and Mandarin Chinese without having to concentrate too hard. Cindy admits that there are bad sides of being bilingual (26). She feels that it can be problematic when a person is neither “super” fluent in both languages. She questions, “Then, where would you stand?” She sees the threat of belonging to neither the culture associated with Mandarin Chinese nor the culture associated with English. When asked if this is the case for her, Cindy answers that it is not really so, but she has thought about it. She adds, “If I keep forgetting [Mandarin] Chinese and my English doesn’t get better…” Cindy has never been judged or treated differently because she is bilingual (27). But she mentions that she has seen such cases in China. She says that people hated it when Chinese students who came back from studying abroad intentionally added English words to their conversations to “make themselves look smarter.” When asked whether she was involved in a similar situation, she answers sheepishly, “Not intentionally. I just do it [adding English words to Mandarin Chinese] when I don’t know how to say it in [Mandarin] Chinese.” To Cindy, bilingualism is not something very special (18). She explains, “because almost everyone is bilingual now.” But she adds that it makes life easier (26). She sees the convenience in being able to visit to places where the languages are spoken. When asked which language she wishes she knew, she mentions Spanish and Japanese (29). She mentions that she has spent years on Spanish, and wishes she can be fluent in it. She also wants to learn Japanese, “for fun.” She adds that the fun lies not in learning the language, but rather in actually being able to use the language. She explains that for places like Japan, where English is not really used, you would want to learn the language when you really like the place. Cindy studied in Tokyo, Japan over the summer – it seems that her desire to learn Japanese is related to the satisfying experiences she has had in Japan. 5 Though bilingualism makes her uncertain about where she would stand between the two languages and the cultures associated with them, Cindy still wants her future partner to be fluent both in Mandarin Chinese and in English (28). She gives her reason for this as, “for communication.” When asked why the partner must know both languages and not just one, since one language is sufficient for communication, she answers, “You’ll feel closer to each other if you know everything they’re saying and you can express yourself freely.” Cindy also mentions that one language alone cannot cover all aspects of her identity. While Mandarin Chinese links her back to her native country China, English represents the years she has spent in the United States and the possibility of a second home. Though Cindy stands at the threshold between Mandarin Chinese and English, the threshold itself has already become another kind of identity for her – she looks for others who are also at the threshold to seek kinship. From Cindy’s story, it seems that bilingualism is not about having to choose one language over the other, but about creating something new out of both.


Linguistics 101 Jiwoo Kim Bilingual Interview 1 A Designer of an Internal World As someone who came from a country dominated with one race and one language, most of my friends speak Korean more fluently than any other languages. Since Korean is the dominant language that is used for all occasions in Korea society, the culture of learning foreign language is not culturally common. One day, I gave up looking for a friend who does speak my mother tongue—Korean, my high school friend Gayle (1) texted me that she was in New York. Gayle is my friend who had the ability of melting my weary soul during high school days and has retained it even after, and she came all the way from California to Bryn Mawr because she had a conference to attend in New York. For a few days after meeting her, I blamed my heart for not recalling my best friend frequently and blamed my loosely wired brain for not linking a person with the appropriate description—bilingual—one should proudly possess. Gayle, having been born in Korea, grew up learning Korean (9). When she was around six years old, she moved to California and started to learn English (4, 5). Ever since learning how to speak English, she sometimes communicates in English with her brother while still speaking Korean with her parents and younger sister (4). She explained the reason she spoke English with her brother as being because, “I had to spend most of my time with my brother who is just a year apart with me. As we played with American friends after school, we changed our main language from Korean to English.” While she was using English as a main communicative tool in her elementary school in California, her parents helped her to be more comfortable at using English by motivating her. She recalls, “While I was in regular American preschool,” she recalls, “one day, my parents bought the series of Junie B. Jones. They gave me a sticker each day after I completed reading by speaking aloud while listening to the audio. The collection of fifty stickers was my life-time goal in those days because it meant I could buy six Hershey chocolates.” As she finished each series, her parents brought her thicker and more challenging English books. One day she realized, “I was addicted to reading English book and craved more and more until I needed to go to bed”. Then in her 6th grade winter break, while she was looking around her father’s Korean bookfilled room, she discovered, “I was not able to understand most of the words. For some of the books, even understanding the title of the book was hard.” After spending five years in Linguistics 101 Jiwoo Kim Bilingual Interview 2 American elementary school, she found out not only reading Korean but speaking Korean challenging. “Thinking back, I think I learned both languages in school and at home in order to survive” (10). When she was an elementary student, she spent most of her time at home talking with her brother (9). “We did our homework and played together using English. For both of us, English was more comfortable since we spent our whole days in school using English. But when we talked with parents, we tried to use Korean to connect with them better.” However, the longer she spent in school with friends who spoke English, her comfort in English grew, and it led her to change the way she formed sentences while speaking with parents. Since both of her parents are professors who are used to reading complicated English theses or experimental results, she said that they could understand her sentences even when she used English words, though a Korean grammatical structure, to explain her thoughts (9). “When I was using a fair amount of English words with my parents while maintaining Korean structure, I believed I could probably translate the English words right back into Korean.” However, after three months, she began to realize the loss in her Korean ability. Amongst vibrant and heart-warming giggles, she told me that “In sophomore year in middle school, on Chuseok [the Korean traditional Thanksgiving], I was calling with my grandparents. When they asked me what I usually learned in school”, she became quiet for a while and slowly spoke each word by word, “I wanted to tell them our class creates various styles of poems in English literature class. But at that moment, I was not able to remember how to say ‘various’ in Korean and asked them to wait until I found the word—dayanghan-- by searching on a computer dictionary” (11). Her difficulty in remembering the word dayanghan shocked me because it is a relatively easy word that most of the elementary students would use. I then asked her how could she speak Korean so fluently now. I learned that although it was a hard journey to recover her mother tongue, her Korean skills started to improve after she returned to Korea. “Coming back to Korea after six years in California, I struggled to adjust to middle school. The only class that I could look forward was English, when I would undoubtedly be the best, and all my peers would be awed” (27). She added that in South Korea, where knowledge and skills are the most treasured, her English skills defended her from being ostracized by her Linguistics 101 Jiwoo Kim Bilingual Interview 3 classmates. “It was my first experience of knowing that language was an asset, and power” (26). Here, Gayle paused and laughed at how I had stopped blinking—an unfixable habit of mine when I focus on something—before continuing. She told me, “so my motivation of learning Korean was insuppressible after feeling that thrill and confidence,” but she acknowledged that her internal motivation was not the only cause that led her to be perfect bilingual. The fact that the environment she had to be part of—both in academic and nonacademic setting—completely changed into Korean was another major factor. After finishing a challenging journey in middle school, she entered a high school which used both languages. “When I entered high school, I recognized my Korean and English balanced equally,” she said in relief. “Luckily, two years of not using English even with a single person did not prevent me from losing skills in English.” Currently a sophomore at Claremont McKenna, nineteen-year-old Gayle speaks mostly English in her day-to-day life but keeps speaking Korean in home (2). She feels fluent enough in both languages to do business in either language (6). But when I asked her to pick one dominant language, she hesitated for a while but then said firmly “probably English” (4). She explained her reasoning, telling me that when she speaks to herself, most of the time she uses the English, though this is affected by the language used in external environment that she is part of. “While I was in high school, I used to think in Korean, but I think my thought process work in English now. It’s probably because of how often I use English, and the fact that all the vocabulary I need to use to explain my thoughts—both academic and personal— are now learned in English. But I think in Korean when I’m back in Korea” (12). Although the language Gayle thinks in is inconsistent and depends on the language spoken around her, she told me she hardly mixes the language. “Not usually. Only when a Ko-nglish word is accidentally used because I thought it was a real word” (15). Gayle’s eyes widened when we started to discuss language system in subconscious realm of human beings. “Sadly, my language while dreaming seems to function similarly when I am thinking. I dream usually in English, since my dreams will have English-speaking people. If I’m having dreams with Korean-speaking people, it’ll be in Korean” (13). I then shared my experience of dreaming in the language that I couldn’t understand—the words that do not exist on Earth— and she burst out laughing. She found my dream interesting while thinking her dream banal. Linguistics 101 Jiwoo Kim Bilingual Interview 4 For Gayle, her dream is natural since she believes her brain creates the images in her dreams, because brain is also responsible for thinking. The idea of associating language with part of our subconscious—dreaming and feeling—grasped her attention so strongly that she started tapping the desk and talking excitedly, “Hang on. Let me think why languages used in dreaming and describing feelings are so different.” Then she threw her hands up in the air, “I can’t come up with any reason why dreaming and feelings do not work similarly. I think I express my feelings more eloquently and precisely in Korean, when I’m extremely emotional. It’s hard to be angry in English, because even though it’s more dominant, it’s still uncomfortable” (14). She believes the reason for her discomfort when dealing with emotions in English is because there are more words in Korean that describes her feelings more accurately. She said that she can remember exact words that express her feeling with specific nuances learned through Korean books or media. She gave the example ‘sadness’ to discuss about how different kinds of words can be used to express sadness, “Selpen, Seguelpen, and seorowoon and etc”. Again, throwing her hands up in the air, she shared the difficulty of dealing with emotions using English even with her friends in college setting. “Every time I realize that I can’t express my feelings perfectly in English, I feel like I’m losing control of understanding my feelings, communicating them, and dealing with them in healthy manner” (19). She became silent for a while and asked me about how I perceived her personality change after she came to college. I said I could not think of any obvious changes except her body gestures became more diverse. Beaming with pleasure, Gayle started to talk about she feels her using English dominantly in college has caused her to be an ‘extrovert turning into an introvert’, which is a common phenomenon occurring among young people. “I feel like I’m more private when I am in an English-speaking environment because I’m tired of the way my words are never enough to express my feelings. I haven’t yet found the English words I need” (21). Gayle defining herself as introvert shocked me so much that I almost forgot that I was interviewing her. After spending three years with her in high school, the first words I would associate with Gayle was sociable and decisive, which, in fact, was completely shattered at that moment. She giggled at my widened eyes and gaping mouth, and said “breathe”. She told me that her limitations of expressing emotions in English might not be the Linguistics 101 Jiwoo Kim Bilingual Interview 5 only cause that resulted in her personality changing in college. She attributes insufficient experience of achieving her goals in English-speaking environment to be one of the main causes of her character change. “I haven’t yet built up enough of a history in an Englishspeaking environment that attests to my virtues or skills.” She explains she becomes outgoing when she speaks Korean, “I’m more confident and assertive when I speak Korean, because I unconsciously associate Korean with my history of over-achieving in Korea, as well as my confidence in myself that I’ve built in Korea” (12). When we were discussing the possible causes that can lead people to prefer one language to another, Gayle realized that the reason for her personality change—loss of confidence and becoming more reserved—when using English was different from common causes of other people. Unlike typical case in which judgement of other people about one’s language ability prevents someone from keep learning it, Gayle realized that her loss of confidence is not so. “Korean speakers see me as a gyopo[Korean who has grown up abroad], because of my accent, rhythm in speech, and my assertive and frank personality, which shows in the things I speak” (23). Even with lots of questions about her background and language, she says she feels confident whenever she speaks Korean with people who speak perfect Korean. Gayle told me that like Koreans, English speakers also judge her language ability and make assumptions about her background. “Americans view me as an immigrant, due to my Korean accent and the occasional pause that I take to think about which words to use. Sometimes I say things that mean different things to people more versed in the nuances of English” (22). She emphasized with her typical hand gesture—a vertical palm gesture with rigid hand, “For me, I feel introverted even with the people who speak English as their second language who do not judge my English at all and who are my best buddies.” While Gayle has experienced language barriers in both languages and partially lost her most valuable characteristics, confidence and affability, she still likes being bilingual and wants to learn two more languages (17). She concedes the fact that being bilingual possesses obvious limitations because she could “probably never be included” in any one language and “the ability to speak and think in one language affects the ability to speak and think in another sometimes” (16). But she highlighted that being able to speak in two languages fluently gives and has given her a wider perspective on the world by sharing her story after Linguistics 101 Jiwoo Kim Bilingual Interview 6 she came back from California to Korea (25). “Being bilingual meant that I had more perspective and freedom of choice, outside the boundaries that my middle school friends were in. I was aware that my language skills allowed me to gain more chances to get involved around campus easily, and my teachers encouraged my studying to make use of the skills I had” (26). Gayle especially enjoyed the fact that being fluent in English has broadened her perspective, “English opens up my world, provides me the opportunity to associate a variety of cultures.” She also believes Korean is an extremely limited language but still crucial. “The language itself is limited to knowing just Korea, the Korean peninsula. But without it, I will lose my ability to understand my internal self”. Gayle told me the environment plays the significant role in learning language. She shared her perspective of how bilingual is perceived differently in Korea and America. She said, “Being fluent English speaker in Korea gives me a lot of privilege and social recognition whereas being bilingual in America is more common than being monolingual” (26). However, she believed that bilingual dominant culture itself does not necessarily motivate people to learn another language, especially for immigrants. “In America, although being bilingual is more common, people who are clearly more fluent in English than in their other languages are treated more as an insider”. She spoke about her old friend Lila who went primary school with her. “Lila’s parents did not want Lila to speak Korean. They never taught her.” At that time, Gayle couldn’t understand why Lila could not speak Korean. “When I asked my parents about the reason, they told me Lila’s parents wanted her to be completely part of America by changing her language.” Although Gayle also feels using English perfectly can make her an insider, she still believes learning new languages can lead her to become more objective to unfamiliar beliefs and cultures. Being bilingual led Gayle all along to United States. Small things that came with being talented in English built up her confidence, led her to challenge herself to get into a prestigious international high school, and further go to an American college. She remarked, “far from where I had started, as a middle school student who once got a 23 on a test.”

Nanako Komatsubara Bilingualism Interview 16th November, 2017 Being Incomplete and Unique: Not One or the Other I interviewed my friend Sayori Yoshida (1), a 20-year old (2) sophomore of Bryn Mawr College. She was born in Fukushima, Japan, but moved to Osaka, Japan when young and later moved to upstate New York when she was seven years old and has lived there ever since until she started her college life at Bryn Mawr (3). She speaks English and Japanese fluently (4), where Japanese is her mother tongue and English was her second language, which she picked up as she moved to the US (5). She believes that her fluency does not differ largely between the two languages, but thinks that she is somewhat better in reading and writing in English (6). Currently, she has a balanced life using both languages, though there were periods of her life where English was almost completely dominant (7). She uses both languages everyday (8), and has used Japanese at home for the most time (9). I immediately thought of interviewing her when I started working on this project, because of our similar backgrounds. We both were born in Japan, and moved to New York at a young age, using both English and Japanese fluently. By interviewing her, I wanted to see the similarities and differences that we had, as well as how her experience being bilingual reflected on herself. This interview was conducted mainly in Japanese, but also had bits and pieces of English, as we understand both languages. Throughout my interview with her, I felt a notion of her exaggerating herself being in a "中途半端" (Chuutohanpa) position - a Japanese word expressing incompleteness. She believes that both her Japanese and English levels are somewhat incomplete, though fluent (11). She believes so because as a person who has not lived in either country for her whole life, she is not as proficient as those who were born and grew up in one country. However, she has no foreign accent in both languages, and also has not immediately noticeable grammatical mistakes in her language usage. When she moved to the US, she spent extensive hours studying English, to be able to understand what her environment is presenting her with. She said that her mother also made her study English very hard, as she had studied English from college, teaching students English when she was in Japan. Along with that, because she made many friends who cannot speak Japanese, her level of Japanese and English once became opposites, where she nearly forgot Japanese due to learning English. However, she started putting effort into practicing Japanese, from the belief that Japanese and bilingualism is a part of her identity (18). She also started practicing Japanese because she thought that bilingualism would allow her to hold an advantage, for example when applying to college, or at social scenes. She says that she especially stood out in her city which she grew up in upstate New York since the majority of the citizens were white and there were few people who understood Japanese, which made her look cool (18). However, though she has practiced Japanese and believes that she has not lost her fluency in Japanese, she believes that this does not make her truly fluent, as her reading, writing and speaking are not perfect yet. She says that when speaking in Japanese, most people first regard her as a fluent speaker, but later understands that she has not grown up in Japan, or studied in Japanese, due to some minor errors in speaking (24). For example, she brought up a recent incident where she mispronounced "hierarchy" in Japanese. Hierarchy does have a Japanese word, but it is also common to use the directly use the English word, spelled ヒエラルキー. However, this word has a very different pronunciation from its original English word, being pronounced "Hee-ehra-ru-key" in Japanese. Therefore, when she pronounced "hierarchy" imitating the English pronunciation, native Japanese speakers couldn't understand what she meant. Yet, she does not regard herself as truly fluent to English either, because people do not believe her to be fluent because of her looks, as well as her accent, which makes her make the typical l and r pronunciation mistake which many Japanese speakers have (24). She also tends to mix Japanese and English while speaking if she speaks with a person who understand both languages (17). This may also be contributing to her belief that her mastery of both languages is incomplete. She uses Japanese and English contextually, thinking in English most of the time since she spends her life in the US taking classes at Bryn Mawr. She thinks in Japanese when with her family and when doing work for her Japanese class that she currently takes. She says that she needs to put effort to be able to think in Japanese in situations where she would normally use English (14). For example, she finds trouble thinking in Japanese for school related issues, such has classwork and class registration. Since the majority of her life is in English now, she says that many of her emotions, such as anger, comes out in English (16). As we started talking about using languages in different contexts, we also touched on our relationship with our families and the language we use with them. While talking, Sayori told me about how her mother has a job that causes her to frequently travel around the world. Her mother has gone to a myriad of countries for business trips, and each time brought her gifts from those countries when she came back. Along with that, as her mother had a job that was music related, Sayori was exposed to music from various countries and cultures as a child, which connects to her current aspiration as a Dance major. Because of such experiences, she sees music as a global language. However, she does not regard herself to be multilingual because of such experiences, as she does not use music for direct communication with others. In addition, though she sees music as a type of language, she also regards it as a type of art, which is another reason why she does not regard herself to be multilingual. She also explained to me how being bilingual has definitely added on to her life experience overall by allowing her to understand things in both languages. However, it is also a delicate aspect as she must make sure to practice both languages to keep up her fluency, at least to the incomplete level that she currently believes she is in (26). Though she would like to study more languages, such as French, which she currently takes a course on, she thinks that she cannot take anymore at this moment because of the fragile balance that she must maintain between Japanese and English (29). She told me she thinks that if she becomes multilingual, she would by large chance be lowering her proficiency in English and Japanese. However, I had a very strong impression on how she had not completely taken her "incompleteness" as a negative aspect of herself. Though Sayori describes herself as Japanese when introducing herself to others, she does not think she is truly Japanese, because of her long life overseas, being exposed to non-Japanese cultures. Yet, she does not regard herself as Japanese American or American, for various reasons, such as not being raised in the US or in an American family, as well as holding a Japanese passport. Instead, she regards herself as a "世界人" (sekai-jin), directly translated as a "world-person". Being exposed to many languages and cultures as a child has made her a somewhat incomplete person, being Japanese but not being able to truly identify with a certain ethnicity or nationality. She mixes her Japanese and English at certain moments because of phrases and sayings that she cannot remember of (17), and uses the two languages in different contexts, finding it hard to use the languages in situations that she usually does not use them for. However, this incompleteness has instead allowed her to absorb bits and pieces of resources from both the American and Japanese cultures. In addition, with music, she was able to absorb information from a myriad of cultures. This allowed her to establish her own, unique position as a "world-person". It very much astonished me how she took what would generally be thought of as a negative aspect (incompleteness), and turned it into her own unique positivity. When I asked her exactly what kept her from forgetting Japanese, as she did have periods of time when she was almost completely immersed in English, she explained to me how she believes that it is an advantage and a part of her identity, as well as how she thought it was "もったいない(mottainai)" for her to forget Japanese. もったいない is a Japanese word that expresses how something would be wasteful if thrown away. In this case, she believed that it would be a waste for her to forget Japanese here and now, looking at other acquaintances that could not speak Japanese though having Japanese parents and background. She told me that she felt a kind of danger when she started to forget Japanese, and started studying Japanese once again. From my interview with her, I first thought that her bilingualism in Japanese and English had caused her to lose her identity as a Japanese person, unable to find a place to reside with. Indeed, she regards both her English and Japanese levels as "fluent, but not fluent compared to real native speakers who were born and raised in that country". Therefore, she regards herself as "incomplete". However, this incompleteness, along with her connection with music since youth, has instead allowed her to change into a "world-person", being neither Japanese nor American. By being a "world-person" Sayori is able to understand and absorb information from a myriad of cultures, not restricted to Japan and the US. Sayori, through her bilingual experiences, has found a way to turn her "incompleteness" into her advantage.

Being Bilingual Is Just a Thing I Am

For this project, I interviewed a friend, Chloe, a Junior at Bryn Mawr College (1). Although I knew a bit about her background, I learned more about her as well as how she sees herself as a bilingual who was born in Korea but has not been back for about 10 years now. Chloe reflected positively overall about her experiences as a bilingual, and seemed to see it as a positive aspect of her life. As she has been primarily speaking English, living in the US for a number of years now, she feels like her Korean culture is somewhat distant. The interview was largely informal, as Chloe and I are comfortable with each other, although I felt like I had to specifically ask some of the questions to direct the flow of the conversation.
Chloe is 20 years old (2), and was born in Seoul, South Korea (3), but her family now lives in California. Chloe speaks both Korean and English (4). She shared that she started speaking Korean from birth but learned English at around age 5, as it was mandatory for children to learn English in Korea at school (5). “Even if I did not come to the US, I would have still known English.” As a result, she feels very fluent in both languages (6). She considers English to be her dominant language, as she uses it the most (7). Her primary language at home is Korean, but only when speaking to her mother and her mother’s side of the family does she speak Korean. Her brother is not as fluent in the language, and her dad’s side of the family largely lives in the US, so she primarily speaks to them in English (8). 
When asked about the context of when she uses the two languages, she explained that she only finds herself speaking Korean or has a need to when speaking to her mother (12). She associates English with America and feels like Korean is “more close to home”, where she was raised. Although it is kind of distant, she still associates it with Korean culture.” (20) Since [she] hasn’t been back to Korea in 10 years, [she] “finds Korean somewhat distant. Chloe says that she is still “fluent in Korean,” but seems to have “lost touch” with the modern slang. She “tries to speak Korean with her parents, but does not speak to them as often.” She “speaks more to friends and professors on campus” and “only speaks Korean about twice a week.”
Furthermore, she does not seem to mix the two languages, unless she is unable to find a Korean word to use to translate a word or phrase from English, in which case, she uses the English word mixed with other Korean words, something she sees herself doing purposefully (17).  She sees this as one of the negative aspects of being bilingual, which has often led to frustration when trying to explain things that may not be easily translated (21/26).  When explaining customs week to her mom, [she] found it hard to find the right words for HA, and customs people.” She also had difficulty explaining the concept of traditions at Bryn Mawr, as there is no a similar concept in Korea. This could be negative, as she wants her mother to understand her experiences, but may not be fully able to convey them in a way that her mother will be able to comprehend.
Chloe communicates in English, no matter what mood she is in and what emotions she is feeling. (16) It was interesting to hear that she thinks and dreams primarily in English. Only when talking to her mom, does she think in Korean, as a result of the language she has to use in that context. Although this is mostly automatic, she says that she is also sometimes aware of this fact (14/15). It is interesting to see that the way she thinks depends on the context and what language she is using in the situation. She mentioned that she does not think in Korean anymore, possibly implying that she used to, when Korean may have been more prominent in her life. This reminds me of the Arrival movie, as when the main character was able to understand the alien’s language, she was able to “think” in terms of their language as well. According to the linguistic relativity hypothesis, she may think in a different way when talking to her mom, as a result of speaking Korean. This may also explain why it is often difficult to translate some specific English words and phrases to Korean, as there may not be a way of thinking about concepts such as “customs week” in Korean.
Being bilingual has allowed her to understand the grammar of the language as well as “understand the culture.” (18) In learning the language, she is able to understand the culture as well. This shows the link between language and culture, as language can be used to convey cultural values, such as the value of respect for people who are older than you. In Korean, there is an added layer of respect, so you have to change the way you speak to different people such as elders in the family, a distinction that is not really present in the English language. I found this interesting, as this is the case in Hindi, the language my family speaks as well, something that has led me to be conscious of this when speaking in English as well.
Chloe does not see being bilingual as a disadvantage, and never saw it in a bad way. She says that “being bilingual, its just a thing that [she] [is].” (26). Some advantages she sees of being bilingual include that she is exposed to different cultures and she “can communicate with more people than [she] would otherwise be able to”. One disadvantage she mentioned was the realization that she can’t translate some words, and has to look them up to translate them. (26) Also, new people she meets in her classes seem surprised that she speaks Korean, they think that she only speaks English (27). Only when they hear her speak Korean do they know that she is a native speaker. Many people have the assumption that someone only speaks one language, only when they hear the person speaking a different language do they know that they are bilingual. This is an example of how our first impressions of people are often biased and only when we fully get to know someone do we really learn about them.
Asking about how others view her bilingualism led to a conversation about her family and their involvement in her continued practice and engagement with these languages. She noted that her grandparents were insistent that she didn’t forget Korean, so they pushed her and her brother, but her brother didn’t retain Korean as well. It seems like her family saw the importance of preserving Korean language and culture. (25) She feels like she was never discouraged, only encouraged, but maybe pushed a bit too much in some sense. Her mom “doesn’t push her brother, since he does not really understand Korean.” She feels like she is pushed, because “she is more fluent in the language, and when talking to her mom, the conversation naturally flows in Korean.” She also explained that she sees this as generational, as her grandparents pushed her mom to be bilingual, as they wanted her to study abroad and learn a new language. Her mom then pushed her, possibly wanting to continue the tradition of bilingualism in the family. 
When asked about her future and if she would want her children to be bilingual as well, she indicated that she had never thought about that before. She remarked that she “would like [her] children to be bilingual, but wouldn’t push them.” She also mentioned that she “wants to give them the freedom to choose which languages they want to learn and how far they want to take them.” As the in interview came to a close, I asked Chloe if she wishes she knew another language. Having taken Spanish in high school, but forgotten some of it, she wishes that was another language she had, as well as Chinese, having only taken it for a year as a freshman. 
Overall, the interview was informative, and gave me an understanding of the different meanings the two languages Chloe speaks have for her. I also learned about the contexts she uses the two languages in, and which she feels is more dominant. Although she was born in Korea, and grew up largely speaking Korean, now she sees her primary language as English, which may be a factor of the environment and people she interacts with. Her family clearly encouraged her to maintain fluency and practice the language they speak, one that clearly has a lot of meaning for them. They did not want her to forget the culture, after moving to the US, however she may have found their efforts pushing her a bit too much. After speaking with Chloe, I am able to see how she seems to identify more strongly with English language and culture, but still remains connected to her Korean culture. This may be due to the fact that she has now spent a large part of her life in the US, and is mostly around native English speakers. Chloe sees several advantages of being bilingual, including being able to understand not only another language but culture as well. She would want her children to be bilingual, but would give them the freedom to choose which languages and at what level they want to learn them at. 

Minzhi Li Linguistics101 Bilingualism Final Paper 11/16/2017 Blossoms Amid Snows For this assignment, I interviewed my childhood friend, Adele Huang (1), who is now 23 years old and lives in Boston (2). She was born and raised in South China (3). We attended the same kindergarten but her family moved to another city in China when she was six years old. She transferred to a private high school in Massachusetts at age 16 and graduated from Wellesley College last year. She is currently working for a consulting firm in Boston while applying to graduate school. Adele is fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English (4)(6). Adele speaks Mandarin with her family and with her Chinese friends but uses English for school and work (8)(12). This interview traces the “pathway” Adele has taken as she explored the language of English and deepened her understanding of American culture. Her story is about struggles that a person could take and also about tenacity that waits for its chance to blossom. “So you used up your language talent before you could get your hands on French, huh?” I provoked, deliberately putting on a smirk, after Adele told me that she also learned French in college but did not make it to the advanced level. “Noooo…” Adele immediately defended herself, singing that single syllable out, but that crescendo quickly vanished, replaced by a string of giggles after she realized that my seemingly critical comment was just a façade. “I thought, if I study French too hard, it will ruin my English. You know it is hard enough to have achieved fluency in English already. One more [language] is just too much [for me] (5)(6),” Adele explained softly, with a playful tone, a note so familiar. She slowly unveiled story as a multiple language learner and acquirer. Adele grew up speaking Mandarin (5)(9). It is her first language, and the only language that her parents speak. Cantonese, Adele’s second language, is only spoken in South China. Both of Adele’s parents were originally from North China before they got married and settled in the south. As she related, “My parents understand Cantonese but they just never speak Cantonese. [It’s] Just too late for them to learn a new language.” Adele said this matter-of-factly, explaining that’s why she only speaks Mandarin to her parents (9). “One day, I came home from 2 kindergarten and started singing in Cantonese. It startled my parents,” said Adele. “They never expected me to learn a new language so quickly and so … so secretly.” Adele giggled and couldn’t hide her excitement. “Actually,” she added, “I am surprised myself, to realize that I picked up a new language on my own, from outside my family (5). I wish I could do the same with my English, but it was just too late…just like it was too late for my parents to learn Cantonese.” Adele pursed her lips and I couldn’t help but sense a trace of melancholy in her expression. But Adele continued, “You know, sometimes I just wish I can speak like the native speakers.” Speaking like a “native” is not the same as being fluent, I wanted to point out. However, I saw that the tunnel of Adele’s hope of becoming effortlessly multilingual slowly bricked shut; she had decided that she would never speak perfect English because she had learned the language a bit too late, after living most of her life in China. By the time Adele came to the States for high school at age16, she was already imprinted with Chinese culture. Mandarin is written all over her body: the language is contained in and conveyed by Adele’s smiles, her manners, and her memories. Mandarin is how Adele recognizes and remembers herself; it is also how she identifies herself. Even after years in the U.S., Adele still regards Mandarin as her dominant language. It is the code through which she can retrace her footsteps down the ladder of her childhood and stir up memories (7). While environment does matter in the case of acquiring a new language, it matters only after the connections in the brain are wired shut, so to speak. Adele witnessed this phenomenon with her parents, who tried but failed to learn another language. It wasn’t easy for Adele to learn English, either, despite her youth. She explained, “When I transferred to the high school in the States, I felt so lonely because everyone around me just suddenly spoke in a different language and nothing was familiar to me. Foods were different, too.” Adele put on a look of desperation. “Those are what I call my silent years, because I didn’t know what to say, and I sometimes felt intimidated by the language, but in the end I guess I survived.” Adele smiled a little, a smile atop layers of struggles and years of assimilation, a flower blossom amid snows. Adele had always struck me as a person who could thrive in difficult situations, someone who set the bar higher and higher for herself, seeking challenges and conquering them. Yet, even for Adele, moving to the States presented almost too many obstacles; she had to navigate a new culture by herself, sailing in a sea of confusion with no map. She also had to reinvent herself. As 3 she explained, when you move to a new country and try to assimilate, “No one knows who you were and what you have achieved in the previous culture. You have to start over again. It was very frustrating because even though I can write beautifully in Mandarin, I had to line myself up with 9th graders to study how to write an essay in English again. Nothing in your past counts!” Adele stopped for a moment to collect herself, as if bringing up past learning struggles unearthed strands of bitterness that she had tucked away years ago. Changing territories is stressful: adaptions to new circumstances are hard-won—but adaptations occur nonetheless. Time and experience eventually worked their magic on Adele. After several years of watching and listening, learning and experimenting, Adele felt much more comfortable and confident expressing herself in English. Now, her new language has imperceptibly merged into her life: Adele she not only thinks and reads in English, but she also dreams in English (14) (15). She is surprised to hear, when I point it out, that dreaming in another language is a mark of developing fluency. After the struggle of learning an alien language and years spent trying to perfect its quirks and nuances, Adele realized, “There is good and bad at being bilingual. The good thing is that you get to see the world and sometimes [it] almost [felt] like you get to live another life.” She suddenly smirked, as if she was about to disclose an unflattering secret: “The bad thing (26) is that I stand less chance to win an argument against my mom now because I literally forget certain words or phrases in Mandarin—in midsentence! I also stutter when I speak Mandarin now because when I want to express some feeling in Mandarin, words and phrases in English spring up to me by default and I have to translate them back to Mandarin (22).” Adele also remarked on how learning to speak English affected her ability to speak Cantonese: “I was on the plane flying back to China one summer and the guy sitting beside me spoke Cantonese. We started chatting, but I found myself utterly speechless because I couldn’t find the tone. I had to listen to him speaking for ten minutes before I could tune in. It was so funny that he said I had an accent when I spoke Cantonese. It felt a little surreal to speak Cantonese after so long, but once I got back home and was surrounded by local people, it quickly felt natural again.” “Being bilingual is like seeing the world through a kaleidoscope. There are more colors and more angles. More frustrations, yet more surprises, as well,” Adele said (18). She then brought up her one of her favorite stories. Adele was in a meeting with her English professor to talk about a paper she wrote. The professor circled the phrase ‘swallowed the tears into his heart’ 4 on her paper and told her that this does not make sense in English. “He told me that in English I don’t need to attach ‘into his heart’ to the end of ‘tears,’ and I was so baffled because it makes perfect sense in Mandarin.” Adele mimicked her past confusion, emphasizing her surprise. She explained that in Mandarin, ‘Swallow the tears into her/his heart’ means someone suffers inwardly. Also, ‘into her/his heart’ is actually a key part of the phrase because it shows where the tears go; readers of Mandarin automatically know that the character is suffering in silence and there might be much more than he/she lets on. The idiom “swallowed his tears into his heart” conveys a tangible sense of loneliness and melancholy (21)—albeit one that does not resonate in English. Languages contain nuances, special codes that only native speakers will truly understand. For this reason, Adele is concerned about finding a partner who understands the nuances of Mandarin, her original language. As she put it, “A language definitely tells a story about who you are, where you come from, and what you believe in.” Adele thinks that her second and third languages should be shared by her potential partner, as well: “I definitely hope that my future spouse can speak as many of the languages I speak as possible!” Adele gave a hopeful smile and continued, “If he doesn’t speak English or Mandarin as fluently as I do, he probably won’t be able understand the struggles I have gone through, either.” As for her future offspring, Adele said she definitely would encourage them to learn any language they are interested in (28), but as early as possible. Getting an early start could help Adele’s children avoid some of the struggles with language learning that she experienced. The hard work that must be done to learn another language is worth it, however, Adele explained: “Languages are useful tools to explore the world and languages are powers, especially for future generations.” When struggles exhaust a person’s capacity for survival, he or she might succumb to self isolation or take risks to find acceptance or niches within multicultural environments. Adele has done the latter. Now, when she thinks of the difficulty she has had learning English, Adele remembers these tribulations with a smile, thankful that they have been part of her life, adding another layer of color to her world. 

Как се казваш? What’s your name? Abstract: Antonia George is nineteen years old and was born in Sofia, Bulgaria (1-3). Her family came to the U.S. when she was three years old and moved around various locations, including Las Vegas and San Francisco, before settling in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. She primarily grew up in northern Virginia, where she still spends her summers and vacations, but has since relocated to Montréal, Québec to attend McGill University (3). Antonia speaks four languages: English, Bulgarian, Spanish, and French (4). Her first languages were Bulgarian and English and she learned Spanish and French later in life beginning at twelve and eighteen years old, respectively (5). Since Antonia is a native bilingual, she is fluent in both Bulgarian and English; however, she still considers English her dominant language (6-7). She speaks Spanish with advanced proficiency, though not as advanced as her two native tongues, and considers her French to be at a basic conversational level (6). She uses English and Bulgarian everyday (8). She uses French everyday while in Montréal to read signs on the street or talk to cashiers, but tends to only use her Spanish in the U.S. since there aren’t as many Spanish speakers in French-speaking Canada (8). Antonia uses Bulgarian at home as well as some English phrases that “don’t translate the same way” or “feel more correct” (9). “What is your name?” It’s a seemingly simple question, but I realize at the start of my interview with Antonia George that for some people the answer can be rather complex. Antonia came to the U.S. from Bulgaria with her parents when she was three years old, but she originally came with the name Antoniya Georgieva. The family decided to change their last name when many difficulties arose due to differences in male and female names in Bulgarian (27). For example, her father had the last name Georgiev and she had the last name Georgieva. Mistakes were often made with spelling (even on formal documents and credit cards) and pronunciation of the last name, so the family decided to change their last name to George. After Antonia began school, she Americanized her name to Antonia because the “y” in the original spelling of her last name tended to confuse people. The “ya” is translated from Bulgarian, in which a singular character is able to represent the “ya” sound (21). Courtney Link 2 Antonia goes on to explain other instances where the languages don’t necessarily match up (21). There is a phrase in Bulgarian “Загубена работа” that directly translates to “lost work.” However, the true meaning of the phrase is much more complicated than the direct translation and she finds it hard to accurately explain. Her best description of the meaning of the word is how it would be used: when you’re annoyed and feel like something is unfair or “dumb.” Essentially, it is a tamer version of bullsh*t, but in Bulgarian this phrase isn’t necessarily a curse word—it’s just a way to express emotion. Antonia tends to use Bulgarian when she is emotional, especially angry (16). She has noticed that when she is arguing with her sister she will almost always switch to Bulgarian because she feels like there are “better words to express feelings” in Bulgarian. Perhaps this is because Antonia has been around Bulgarian since she was born, but she didn’t start hearing English until she moved to the U.S. at age three. Although we are talking through a computer screen, I feel like I am at the George household. The family moves around the house like well-choreographed dancers; seemingly going in different directions, yet somehow there’s a synchrony to it all. The overall welcoming atmosphere and sense of togetherness of the George family is best described by the inclusion of the whole family in the interview process. Throughout the interview, Antonia’s parents and sister chime in to share their own thoughts and experiences with their uses of language. As the interview progresses, I realize the very nature of Antonia’s family is reflected in their use of language. The George family primarily uses Bulgarian at home, but English words or phrases often find their way into the family’s conversations with ease (17). It is common for Antonia to use English words with Bulgarian grammatical endings. Interestingly, she explains the usage of one language over the other is rarely a mistake. When asked if the mixing of Bulgarian and English was on purpose or accident, Antonia’s response was “both.” Since Antonia’s immediate family is fluent in English and Bulgarian, it is common for Antonia and her younger sister to mix words while talking to their parents without a second thought. For example, instead of saying “I am studying” completely in English or Bulgarian, Antonia would say “study-vom.” This mixing of words isn’t because she “forgets” the Bulgarian word for study, but it is because she genuinely feels like the English word in this scenario more accurately represents what she is trying to say. The word that she would use for “study” in Bulgarian translates to something more like “learn” in English and it doesn’t feel quite right to her (21). Courtney Link 3 Another interesting example of code switching used by Antonia’s family is a sentence uttered by Antonia’s younger sister, which consisted entirely of words that were neither English nor Bulgarian, but a mixture of both. When trying to say “you’re hurting my feelings,” she said “hurt-vash mi feeling-iti.” Although this sentence is not understandable to someone who speaks only English or only Bulgarian, the George family was able to understand the meaning exactly with no explanation necessary. Antonia says she most often finds herself combining English and Bulgarian words with verbs to indicate tense. It is important to note that this blending of words is a unique usage of the language that Antonia would only use with her immediate family and not with other Bulgarian or English speakers. She never accidentally uses English when visiting her extended family in Bulgaria, nor does she accidentally use Bulgarian with English-speaking friends (17). She tends to think in the language she is speaking in, but when she is speaking with her parents she thinks in a mixture of both—similar to how she would speak to them (14). Speaking Bulgarian isn’t just something important to Antonia’s family, but it also helps Antonia to feel more connected to her culture (18). She tends to only have the opportunity to use Bulgarian with her family, since it isn’t a particularly common language in the U.S., so since starting college she has attempted to find ways to use her language more (12). She has become an active member of the Bulgarian club at her school and tries to speak Bulgarian as much as possible with people she meets who know the language. She feels closer to people who she is able to converse with in Bulgarian and has a sense of pride in her ability to do so, but she didn’t always feel that way. When Antonia was younger she was embarrassed of her bilingualism because she was made fun of for pronouncing words incorrectly (27). Her parents offered to let her go to Bulgarian school in D.C., but she refused. Antonia’s mother, Gina, adds her own experiences in facing judgement because she has an accent. Gina describes that “certain areas [she has] lived in that were less diverse tended to be more stand-offish [to her], but in the suburbs of D.C. [she has] found a much more accepting environment due to the diverse population of its inhabitants.” Still, Gina reports feeling overly scrutinized during job interviews in regard to her ability to speak and write clearly in English, despite her fluency (27). Antonia and her mother both recall when they had moved from San Francisco to Virginia and Antonia enrolled in her new elementary school. At this point the George family was fluent in both English and Bulgarian, but Antonia was placed in ESL (English as a Second Language) classes because on the enrollment paperwork she had listed that she spoke Bulgarian at home. After Courtney Link 4 many weeks of fighting the classroom placement, and a call to the school board, Antonia was moved out of the ESL program. Gina attributes this improper class placement to her own accent and the fact that she and Antonia conversed in Bulgarian while in the enrollment office (27). Discriminatory experiences like these as a child fostered Antonia’s feelings of embarrassment and resentment towards her bilingualism, so she often refrained from using Bulgarian when not in her home. As Antonia got older, she began to appreciate her bilingualism more because she realized it was something that made her unique (19). She began to read books in Bulgarian and watch the Bulgarian national team’s soccer games. She enrolled in Spanish classes due to her interest in language during middle and high school and has since achieved advanced proficiency (10). However, she feels that if she were to go too long without using Spanish she would begin to lose fluency in the language (11). In order to keep her Spanish skills sharp, she uses it whenever she can—like at her summer job as a waitress or by changing her phone settings to Spanish (13). She plans to study abroad in Spain next summer in order to solidify her skills and understand more of the Spanish cultural context. Since moving to Montréal, she has started to take French classes so that she is able to read signs on the street and have basic conversations with the citizens of Québec (10). As she continues to mature, her opinions on bilingualism and language in general are continuing to change. At McGill, she “feels less unique” for the languages she knows. Many of her peers know upwards of five languages because McGill attracts many international students—not to mention most people in Montréal tend to speak both English and French fluently. Antonia no longer sees her native bilingualism as an embarrassment and believes that it is important to learn more languages and gain a greater understanding of diverse cultures around the world (19). Currently, her life goal is to learn all six official United Nations languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. After reaching fluency in French, which she hopes to do by the end of her undergraduate years in Canada, she plans to pursue Russian. She sees Russian as the logical next pursuit, given that it uses the Cyrillic alphabet like Bulgarian. She plans to travel Europe upon graduating, ending up in Russia and spending time there to learn the language. Antonia adds that she’s excited to use her given Bulgarian name again, knowing that it will go unquestioned in a country with a language so similar to her native tongue. In fact, she has considered beginning to use her Bulgarian name when not in the United Courtney Link 5 States because her European Union passport still includes the Bulgarian spelling. Although the differences between the two names (Antonia George and Antoniya Georgieva) may seem subtle to an outsider, she feels that they are symbolic of the discrimination her family experienced and the resentment she used to feel towards her bilingualism (27). However, they also represent the new life and all the wonderful experiences her family has had in America. Torn between both sides of the argument, in Canada Antonia simply goes by Toni—a nickname that she feels, for now, is a good compromise between her two languages.

Tu Luan LING 101 October 10th, 2017 How a simple tool can change one’s life For this assignment, I interviewed Lobbi Li(1). Lobbi is a 23-year old graduate student (2). He studies chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. I knew him when I was a freshman and he was introduced by one of my friend to me. This interview was through a phone call and mostly in English, even though both of us have Mandarin Chinese as our native language. Even though we talk only on the phone, I did meet him in person in the past. He looks typical Asian: he has black straight hair and medium tone skin. However, it is hard to tell exactly which county in Asia he is from. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland currently, but he is originally from China. He was born in Wenzhou, China (3). At the age of 18, he moved from Wenzhou, China to Worcester, Massachusetts to complete his undergraduate degree at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He lived in Worcester, Massachusetts for four years and then moved to Baltimore, Maryland. He has been living in Baltimore for more than a year till now. He also has been to many countries around the world, for example, Germany, France, and a lot more countries in Europe. However, China and the United States are the only two places he lived for more than three months. (3) Lobbi ’s native languages are Wenzhounese and Mandarin Chinese. He described Wenzhounese as “a famous dialect of Mandarin Chinese but it sounds like a different language” He knows other languages as well: English, French and Japanese. Lobbi can read in both Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese, English, French and Japanese, but he can only write in Simplified Chinese, English and French. He mentioned that the reasons for know writing these languages were different: “ I do not write French and Japanese since I do not memorize the spelling of the vocabularies very well, but I do not write traditional Chinese even though I know the vocabulary, because they are mostly the same as simplified Chinese. Indeed, I am not able to write the characters.”(4) Lobbi said that he began to speak both of his native languages when he was first able to speak. He speaks Wenzhouness at home both from the time he was a child till now. (9) At his age of 6, he was taught English at his elementary school, and at the moment he was only able to speak a few sentences in English. He described some of the sentences he first learned to used are “How are you”, “What do you do”, and “I am okay”. He said: “ I could easily map these sentences to Mandarin as whole sentences at that time, but I just simply did not know what each word meant.” At his age of 10, he started to learn English grammar and the English sentences he spoke were not limited to what he memorized: He began to compose English sentences himself. He had not learned more languages until his freshman year at college. He chose Japanese as his second foreign languages and had studied Japanese for a year (5). At his age of 22, he began to learn another new language: French (5). He is now still learning French. Since he has learned both Japanese and French in a short period, he considers he only know Japanese and French for elementary levels whereas His English is in advanced level (6). Even though he knows many languages, Lobbi now only speak Mandarin Chinese, English and French in a daily base. He speaks English in public and Mandarin Chinese in chats with his parents in phone. He is taking a French class so he speaks French 4 days a week on class. (8) Among the three languages, he considers Mandarin Chinese as his dominant languages, (7) since he always thinks and talks to himself in Mandarin Chinese. (14) Even though Mandarin Chinese is his dominant language, Lobbi sometimes mix English with Mandarin Chinese. (17) He said: “These is a Chinese student in one of my major class, and we are always working together on homework and group projects. When we talk about something academic, we will speak in Chinese in a mix of some English terms. Most of the chemistry terms are nouns, and they are something we learn only in the English speaking classes. We even do not know what they are called in Chinese. So we have to speak in English for those terms. I cannot say it is intentional since we do not have a choice whether we speak those in English or Chinese if we do not know these in Chinese.” The major reason that Lobbi studies so many different languages is that he is always interested in things in different cultures. He mentioned that back in middle school and high school, he had experienced things from different cultures. Many of his classmates at the moment watch Japanese Manga, Korean and North American TV dramas. Lobbi was also attracted by Japanese Manga. He, however, thought the translated version of the Manga could not fully represent all the languages contexts. He kept encountering translated phrases that did not make sense to him. Therefore, once he came to the college, he took Japanese classes. He described that experience as the following: “ I am not sure I how I really felt when I took Japanese classes. I kept knowing some Japanese vocabularies in the past and finally I can learn Japanese in a systematic way.” Lobbi later admitted that he had lost fluency in his Japanese. He explained “the main drive for me on learning Japanese at the beginning is the Japanese Manga. But now as I grow elder, I feel them less attractive, so I stop reading in Japanese. It is different than English, since I am not required to speak or read Japanese in order to communicate with people around.” Lobbi was correct: Languages are not like those skills such as swimming or driving. The fluency of Languages is the thing requires constant practice. Being in the language environment is the simplest thing to force oneself to practice, and that is the reason why Lobbi will never lose his fluency in English as long as he is in the United States. If a language is learnt because of a temporary interest, the language can easily be lost when that interest goes away. (11) After living off campus for two years, he found himself interested in cooking. He was extremely fascinated by French cuisine and he began to read recipes. He then found out many detailed French cuisine recipes are written in French and this motivated him to study French in graduate school. (10) After learning French for one full year, he is now able of reading recipes and cooks in a more original way. Being multilingual means a lot to Lobbi: Knowing English means he can travel to most countries in the world himself, and he can make a lot more new friends who speak English. (18) I also asked Lobbi, how would his life be if he would have not been multilingual. He said: “I can imagine if I have never learned English, I would be living in a completely different life. The first difference I would say is I would not come to the United States. I would have a completely different career and might engage with a different girl. Well, you know I met fiancée when I was an undergraduate student here in the United States. I am not sure how my life would be without her support.” His honest answer really brought me to thoughts: even though Lobbi only treats English as a tool of communication, who he is possible to meet and what he is possible to do are completely changed by this little tool. I cannot say absolutely about whether being a multilingual will make his life better or worse without knowing what will happen to him in the future, but I can state from his answer that he did go into a different path in life. At the end of the interview, I asked Lobbi whether he prefers his children or partner to be bilingual. He said: “It is very hard to find someone from the younger generation that is not bilingual. Most of education systems require people to study a second language. If you are not born in a country that uses English as an official language, then it is very likely that you will be required to study English. Otherwise you will be required to learn another languages. From my experience, I have not known anyone that is at the same age as me but not bilingual. I personally do not have any preference, but I guess I will end up having a bilingual partner in such environment.”(28) Lobbi also mentioned that he wish he knows Italian, since he thinks Italian has close relationship with Latin and is a modern language that may be useful. (29) From this interview, I know Lobbi is definitely not a linguistic person: he only treats his non-native languages as tools of communication. He learned English because he want to communicate with people around him in the United State. He learned Japanese and French because he wanted to pursue his interests that can mostly be found in those cultures. He did not learn any language just because he has interests in the languages themselves, like sentence structures or beautiful pronunciations. However, these tools, these languages have changed his life greatly: because he speaks English, he is able of pursuing degrees here in the United States. He also met someone that meant so much to him because of that. He also learns other skills like French cooking by knowing the French language, which gave him better living quality. 

Graham Mauro Intro Lingusitics There and Back Again: Re-immersing in language and culture I don’t remember exactly how long I’ve known Hannah. I doubt she does either. We met sometime in elementary school but didn’t really know each other until 5th grade. I had a crush on her best friend and in the process of getting to know her, I started to talk more with Hannah. Things never worked out with her friend (as I am sure you are, of course, shocked to hear) but Hannah and I have been best friends ever since. Over the last nine or so years, we have talked about a lot. I knew she was born in Tokyo, Japan (3) even though she’s lived most of her life in Eugene, Oregon (3). I’ve also heard her speak in English and Japanese (4) both of which she speaks fluently (more accurately she identifies herself as semi-fluent in Japanese which she has known since birth and fluent in English which she learned at two years old (5)(6)). But, at 19 years old (2) we had still never really talked about language or what it means to her to be multilingual. That’s why I chose to interview her for this project. Every year, on the first day of every class, the final name on the roll list ‘Hannah Yaginuma Nute’ (1) would beguile every new teacher. They could get through Hannah just fine. Unfortunately for them, simply calling Hannah would elicit four or five different hand raises. So, they had to brave the double last name. They would get out the first sound Ya- and then start to second guess themselves. Hannah and I would glance at each other, finding the routine both comedic and achingly repetitive. Once the teacher had stumbled through Yaginuma (for reference, for English speakers it is pronounced phonetically as if it were English) they would face one final test: Nute, Still beaming from their apparent success with Yaginuma, they would end with a flourish declaring, “Nuté!” (Nute is from the English side of her family and is pronounced like ‘newt’). Hannah would reluctantly raise her hand and the class would commence. Given this annual ritual, one can imagine that language and identity have always been connected for Hannah. In fact, my favorite moment of the interview came near the end when she told me that, “I think knowing another language is like having a key to an entirely new world.” In retrospect, that’s what the interview was about. It was about how, for Hannah, language is a Mauro 2 key not only to unknown swathes of the outside world but also to connecting and unifying the different worlds and cultures within herself. While it took me 20 years to realize this, Hannah was confronted with the connection between language and identity early on. She was born in Tokyo and, at first, spoke primarily Japanese. However, after moving to the United States as a young child, she remembers deciding to shift to speaking English as much as she could (9) and considers English her dominant language (7). When I asked her why, she told me that, “When you’re younger you always want to fit in… I suppose this is in part why I didn’t want to continue speaking or learning Japanese after I moved the United States.” She saw her bilingualism not as a doorway to Japan but as a blockade between her and the United States. So, she left Japanese behind. As she got older, she “… regretted not learning Japanese, especially because it made communication with my mother and her side of the family difficult.” Finally, in high school, she started to study Japanese and turn back to her bilingualism out of a desire to connect with her family and a part of who she is. She has continued this pursuit into college. Last year, she moved to England to begin studying Japonology at Hertford College in Oxford. As part of the program, she is studying abroad this year in Japan where she now speaks Japanese equally as often as English (8). This brings up another aspect of Hannah’s identity: In addition to being Japanese and American, she’s also British. Her father and his family are all English. While Hannah speaks with a ‘West Coast accent,’ she’s also picked up a few Briticisms and British pronunciations from her father. For example, she says [vɑs] for ‘vase’ and [ɡæɹɪdʒ] for ‘garage.’ Both she and I wondered if she would begin to accommodate to a more British accent now that her peers are primarily British. As soon as we started the interview, the answer was apparent (she had). That alone is not particularly surprising. What was interesting is that around the middle of the interview she stopped talking for a moment, looked at me and said, “This is the most American I have sounded in weeks.” In the space of around an hour, she had already accommodated for me and reverted back to a ‘West Coast accent.’ By the end of the interview, she was speaking as if she had never left Oregon. As we moved later into the interview, the focus shifted to her own critical analysis of her language. Part of Japanology is, unsurprisingly, the study of the Japanese language. Because of Mauro 3 this, Hannah had been reflecting recently on how her personal usage of Japanese and English has shifted throughout her life and had come to a couple of interesting conclusions. The first observation she made was about dreaming. She distinctly remembers dreaming in Japanese as a small child but quickly shifted to dreaming uniquely in English as it became her dominant language. While she still dreams predominantly in English, it is no longer the only language she speaks while dreaming. She recounted that, “Once in a while there will be dreams where the language that I’m speaking in is not English. As for whether the language is Japanese, I am not sure.” (15) This seems to imply that the border between Japanese and English has begun to erode for her. However, when asked about the differences between her languages, Hannah launched into a description of their distinct places in her mind. “Languages tend to emphasize what the culture views as important.” That’s how she prefaced the differences between Japanese and English. She described English as having “… more expressive terms.” That is to say, there are more terms for emotions and thus she naturally wants to use English when describing any emotional state (particularly feelings of love or affection). In contrast, she prefers Japanese for descriptions of natural beauty (12). One of the last things we talked about was, by random chance, the film Arrival. I mentioned it in passing and she immediately started enthusiastically talking about it. She saw it a couple months ago and had evidently been waiting for someone talk to about it. After spending an embarrassing amount of time talking about how much we wanted to be able to write in a cyclical language, Hannah brought it back to the idea of language as a gateway to cultures of this world or any other. She ended the interview by saying that not only does she want her kids one day to be multilingual, but she wished that everyone tried to learn another language. She explained this by saying, “I think knowing another language and thus another culture can make a person more open and tolerant of differences. Something that divides humans today are the differences between us. A world where everyone tries to understand one another would be a far more peaceful place. Just saying.” Combined with the fact that she wants to learn “Right now Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Spanish, French, German everything. Language is super cool!!! [she specified the exclamation points]” This summarizes the mood of the interview as a whole: Mauro 4 excited. With every answer, her love of language and its connection to culture was not only inspiring, but contagious.

Serena Mauro-Brown Linguistics 101 Brook Lillehaugen November 16, 2017 Beautiful, Yet Challenging Claudia is a 19-year-old bilingual speaker of Spanish and English (2). She was born in Texas to parents from Mexico. Claudia grew up speaking Spanish, and learned English from immersion into American culture. Claudia primarily speaks Spanish with her immediate family and sometimes with friends who speak Spanish, as well (8). This interview examines how bilingualism and heritage intertwine on the forefront of an unempathetic America, and how one can use language to gain a deeper understanding of a cultural past. Claudia and I have known each other for about a year. We met in the fall quantitative seminar, a fledgling friendship growing out of our equal dislike for the mathematical process. She was bright and friendly, and had a presence that drew people into her orbit. As the semester went on we spoke often about philosophy and art history; many times she regaled me with tales of her Swarthmore classes taught entirely in Spanish. It was when discussing Spanish poets, philosophers and the vastness of culture within Central and South America, that Claudia truly lit up. I found Claudia infinitely interesting, and when the topic of interviewing someone who was bilingual arose, I instantly thought of her. My desire was to learn not only more about her, but about her connection to Spanish and where her love story with the language began. In this interview, Claudia speaks about how her bilingualism has both harmed and helped her, as well as how race and bilingualism go hand in hand within an American society. Claudia was born in Houston (3), the child of two immigrants from Monterrey, Mexico. Throughout her formative years, Spanish was the sole language spoken in her nuclear family (9). 1 Her parents not only encouraged spoken fluency in Spanish (10), but written as well; Claudia thinks back on moments from her childhood where her mother took time to teach her to write in Spanish, well before she began writing in English. Despite the depth of her linguistic roots in Spanish, Claudia was still a child of America. Here, English was packaged, prepared and ready for consumption around every corner. The television and movies of her childhood were first heard in English, and only later, after her parents purchased Spanish copies, did she hear them in her primary language. As she got older and entered into the primarily monolingual American school system, English became the more used of her two languages. Claudia attempted to speak to her parents in English rather than Spanish. Claudia believes the main reason she wanted to speak English over Spanish at the end of the day was that it had become easier, there was less work involved to continue speaking English after an entire day spoken in English. She smiled lightly as she recalls her mother sternly saying, “To us, to us you speak Spanish.” I wondered if she had lost fluency in Spanish , considering much of her life was surrounded by English - both in school and amongst peers. Claudia recognized that there were moments when her Spanish has faltered (11) - she brought up a stutter she recently developed in Spanish while speaking around her extended family - but she doesn’t consider that a lack of fluency (6). Spanish has been, and always will be, her first language. The language she dreams in (15), the language she thinks in (14), the language that surfaces in moments of anger (16). Her existence is made up of moments in Spanish. Claudia added that since arriving at college, she has attempted to ‘elevate’ her Spanish vocabulary to befit academic conversation - ideally she would like to be able to use Spanish in academia like she frequently uses her English - and when she comes across a word she does not know in English, she first looks up the definition then looks up the translation in Spanish. After about a year-and-a-half of practicing this technique Claudia is pleased to say that her Spanish vocabulary has widened, she is looking forward to improving it even further. When asked who in her life encouraged or discouraged her bilingualism (25), Claudia’s first response was not to reference her parents, instead crediting where she was raised to how she viewed her languages. Claudia was raised in a diverse neighborhood; surrounded by neighbors of color, some of whom spoke Spanish as well, gave Claudia a support system that she didn’t believe she would’ve had if she grew up somewhere else. “If I was a Hispanic person living in a 2 primarily white neighborhood, I think I would’ve been a very different person.” She followed up by stating that the diversity, and the added fact that there were other Mexican, Spanish-speaking families, allowed her to focus less on Americanizing herself and her English. She could grow into her bilingualism without pressure to erase part of her identity to fit in. She noted that the diversity, and support, carried over into her early school years as well. Claudia remembers never feeling left out. She always saw her classmates being picked up by parents who spoke to them in Spanish and interacting with fellow Mexican classmates. Though, Claudia did express there were moments when she was embarrassed by her mother speaking to her in Spanish because of friends she had who did not speak Spanish. Yet, in spite of the encouragement of her bilingualism, there were moments when she did feel discouraged. Said discouragement did not come from a single entity, but rather from an American populous as a whole. Being Mexican and Spanish-speaking cause a lot of personal turmoil for Claudia in her early-teens. She described moments of racism, as well as stereotyping, that plagued her; some of which came from her teachers, and some of which came from fellow classmates. “There were times when I wished I wasn’t Mexican,” Claudia said, in a moment of reflection. She went on to address how her relationship with Spanish changed in the face of American prejudice, “When can I speak Spanish? When can I use my language? When will it harm me and when will it be good for me?” She remembered feeling scared to use Spanish when not in the company of her parents, or friends. There was danger attached to speaking her native language that altered her positive view on being bilingual. For Claudia, race and bilingualism went hand in hand and it is difficult to separate the two. I knew Spanish was Claudia’s first language, but it still intrigued me to know how native speakers viewed her and her Spanish. She stated that there were times, especially when she was younger, where people heard her speak and were surprised to learn that she was not originally from Mexico. “My identity was very tailored and centered on my language. The better I spoke Spanish, the more [I thought] I could be - in my past opinion - respected as a Hispanic.” Claudia acknowledged that she no longer believes that to be true; not only for herself but for other people who may not have such a deep relationship with Spanish. She points out that recently there have been many discussions within the Latinx community on the subject of Latinx people who do not 3 speak Spanish. She went on to state, “You don’t have to speak Spanish to be considered Latino or to identify with your culture.” In fact, many people she knew growing up in Houston did not speak Spanish. Many who did not speak Spanish were second-generation immigrants whose parents either did not know Spanish or wanted their children to fully acclimate to American society without bilingualism standing in the way. Claudia is glad her parents did not take that viewpoint on teaching her Spanish, though she understands the sentiment. I turned Claudia’s view towards the future, asking whether she would want a relationship with a bilingual person at some point. Claudia was adamant about her future partner being bilingual (28). “Or at least, he has to be willing to learn Spanish”, she conceded. Same goes for any possible children. Claudia would like them to be both Spanish and English speakers, as well as be immersed in a different language. Something that Claudia wished her own parents had done for her. Though she did not have that opportunity, she would still enjoy pursuing more languages throughout her life; possibly Italian or French, “or any language I can get my hands on” (29). Claudia is also determined to spend the rest of her life learning about and embracing other Latin American cultures, while also better understanding her own Mexican heritage. As the interview came to an end, I asked Claudia again how she viewed being bilingual - attempting to see if after speaking about her bilingualism, her mind had changed. She left me with this: “[It is] such a beautiful thing, yet challenging to accept.” In a way the quote encapsulates Claudia’s history with her bilingualism. As much as she would not trade her fluency in Spanish or her Mexican heritage, there are moments in her life that forced her to question her relationship with who she was. There will never be an easy road to accepting one’s-self especially when that road is made more difficult by people who do not aim to look past their own prejudice.

Emily Mow 11/16/17 Ling 101 Interview Prof. Lillehaugen Neither 100 Percent Belarussian nor 100 Percent English Viktoryia (Vika) Liashchynskaya is an 18-year-old polyglot who speaks Russian, English, Spanish, and French. She was born in Grodno, Belarus and was raised there until the seventh grade, when her family moved to Ohio. She is fluent in Russian and English and is somewhat fluent in Spanish and French. She started speaking Russian from birth, English in the seventh grade, and Spanish and French, around 12th grade. She considers Russian and English to be her dominant languages as she uses them every day with her friends and family and also because Russian is the only language she speaks at home. She only uses Spanish and French about three times a week and only in the confines of her classes. Though she embraces her multilingual abilities because they give her opportunities to experience different cultures and communicate with people of various backgrounds, she does not feel that she is 100 percent Belarussian or American. When I first encountered her during Customs Week, she did not stand out. She was quiet, wore plain pastel-colored clothes, glasses, and had a very studious aura. But when I found out that she is a polyglot like myself, my perception of her changed. As I got to know her better through our one class together, French, I found her to be the perfect interviewee. Vikotoryia (Vika) Liashchynskaya (1), now 18 years of age (2), was born in Grodno, Belarus. She speaks four languages, Russian, English, Spanish, and French (4) and has been educated in all of them (13). She lived in Belarus until the seventh grade when she moved to Bexley, Ohio with her mother (3). Her mother tongue is Russian and she learned English as a second language through immersion from the age of 13 (5). She now considers herself fluent in both Russian and English (6) which her two dominant languages (7). She also admits using Rosetta Stone when initially learning English but ended up hating it because “the lessons start out of nowhere and cover aspects of the language (vocabulary, grammar) at random!” She further complained, “I still had to look up words when I was using it.” In high school, as her English became more fluent, she was required to take a foreign language at school. In the ninth grade, Vika chose to take Spanish (5, 10). As she was learning Spanish, she realized that she loves to learn languages. This newfound language-learning passion led to her take up French. But one of her friends reacted to her decision by judging her critically, “Why do you wanna learn French when you already know Spanish?” but everyone else around 2 Vika has told her that it is “cool” that she is multilingual (25). She began to self-teach French in the 10th grade (5, 10). She took a placement test and placed out of level one and two which led her to take a level three French course the summer before her 11th grade year. After completing that course, she decided to take French 4 in her 11th grade year. She is now taking a French literature course as a freshman here at Bryn Mawr and aspires to be a Romance Languages major. Though Vika has taken several years of Spanish and French, she only considers herself to be somewhat fluent in both languages because she claims that she “didn’t actually speak Spanish and French until [her] senior year in high school” (6). Though living in America has made Vika use English just about all the time (12), she has not lost fluency in Russian (11) because at home, Russian is the only language spoken (8, 9). She also maintains her Russian by talking to her mother on the phone every evening in Russian (12). However, she did admit that when she talks to her mom on the phone, she suddenly forgets words as if she has to fish it out from somewhere “deep in [her] brain” (11). She told me that she only uses Spanish and French about two to three times each week in class (9, 12) and only uses Russian with her family and also with her friends in Belarus. She said that native speakers of Russian and English definitely consider her as a native speaker though some native English speakers perceive her as having an accent (24, 27). However, because she has not yet encountered native French and Spanish speakers, she is not sure if they perceive her as a native speaker but her teachers have told her she has good pronunciation. Despite considering herself to be fluent in English, Vika still prefers to read books in Russian but watches television in both Russian and English. Interestingly, she sometimes changes the language of her phone settings between all of her languages because “it’s just fun to do” (13). She also thinks in whatever language she is speaking, reading, listening, or writing in and has dreamed in all of her languages but less frequently in Spanish and French than in English and Russian (14, 15). Additionally, contrary to popular belief, Vika does not think differently in one language versus another (22). When I initially asked Vika about whether she behaves differently when she speaks one language versus another, she initially said no, but once we started to talk about the cultures of her languages, she pointed out that, “Living in America and speaking English has made me more outgoing. In Belarus, people are mostly way less outgoing and keep to themselves. So, when I go back to Belarus, I’m too outgoing for Belarussians” (23). 3 When she posts on SNS (social networking sites), she mainly posts in English but in Russian on the Russian Facebook because she says that she has different audiences (13). She is also conscious of her audience when she is very angry, very sad, or very happy because she told me, “When I’m with people, I tend to express my feelings in English but when I’m alone, I express them in Russian” (16). Though she could not come up with any specific examples, Vika added that some curse words in one of her languages does not translate well in the other ones (21). As we transitioned into the questions about identity and the importance of multilingualism, things became more personal. She told me that she feels pretty comfortable speaking any of her languages at any given place. However, in America, at certain moments when she is speaking Russian in public with her mother, there are people who just stare. Vika explained that “none of them stared because they’re discriminatory but rather just out of curiosity.” Therefore, in the USA, she has never been treated as an outsider but when people find out that she is multilingual, Vika expressed, “people have a harder time approaching me and they treat me as if I’m a really smart person” (27). When I asked Vika about the pros and cons about being multilingual she told me that she gave me a lot of positives. She said that she loves being able to talk to more people and becoming closer to the cultures with which she associates her languages (26) which include but are not limited to Russian, Belarussian, American, English, Spanish, Hispanic/Latino, French, West African, and Québécois culture (20). She could only come up with one con which was that when she first came to America, she would frequently mix up Russian and English (26) and that now, she accidentally mixes up French and Spanish sometimes (17). On her multilingualism she said that, “I would say that being multilingual is an important part of me. I like learning different languages and in the process learning about the cultures, embracing and blending them in some aspects of my life” (18). She continued, “I like learning languages because they open up new opportunities” (10). When I asked Vika about how her perceptions of multilingualism has changed over time, she told me, “I realized that I can’t just learn a language without cultural context. Of course, through learning a language, you learn about the culture(s) associated with it but you have to learn about the culture, history, and art with which it is associated” (19). Then I asked her how her languages affected how she identifies herself and she told me, 4 “I don’t know where my home is.” She clarified, “I mean I know that home is wherever my parents are, but we’ve moved so much. Even though I’m Belarussian and American, I don’t feel like a Belarussian anymore and I don’t feel 100 percent American. I’m not exactly treated like a foreigner when I go back to Belarus but as I spend more time and socialize with my friends and family there, I see the differences. I see that I cherish different beliefs and values from them.” When Vika told me that, I almost teared up because it is something that I understand very well. The whole feeling about not belonging anywhere has been something I’ve dealt with my entire life as a half-American-half-Japanese, multilingual, and dual citizen. I have often felt torn between the two countries and at the same time have not felt that I belong to either Japan or America. I think this struggle with identity is something that people who are born into families with multiple cultures, languages, and nationalities can relate to. Furthermore, when I asked her questions about her future intentions, she told me that she would like her future husband to be fluent in any of her languages, but preferably English or Russian (28). Regarding her future children, she said, “Yeah…I’ll try to make them multilingual because if I had the choice of being a multilingual or monolingual as a child, I would definitely be multilingual” (28). She also has other aspirations regarding her multilingualism beyond her future family. Though she wants to focus on her studies with Spanish and French, she would love to learn Portuguese because it is similar to Spanish (29). She also expressed an interest in Mandarin Chinese but seemed to have already given up on the idea of learning it because “it is so different from any of [her] other languages” (29). Because of Vika’s positive answers to these questions concerning her future, I believe that in the end, the concerns over identity that come with being multilingual do not outweigh the benefits of being able to connect with people of various cultures and backgrounds from around the world. 

Meagan Murray-Bruce Linguistics 101 Context: In this draft I’m currently trying to express my interviewee’s perception on how she expresses different emotions based on the language she is speaking. So far I’ve provided some evidence from her experiences which support the claim, also my essay mainly comprises of the rationale in which she ties certain emotions to certain languages. I’m having a hard time tying each paragraph to my “thesis”. The way it’s structured now, all my preceding paragraphs are a build up to the final one in which the final paragraph ties all my points together and it’s more evident why I asked certain questions in this interview. Questions: Is it allowed to focus on just one aspect of the multilingual person or for the purpose of this essay, must I talk about their experience as a multilingual as a whole? Also, what is the ideal way to conclude this type of essay? 1 of 5 “A Door Will Always Be A Door” Mariela (1), age 19 (2) was born in New Hampshire, USA. Growing up predominantly speaking Spanish at home (because it is the language her parents speak) and deriving her education in English, at age 7 she moved to Switzerland where she was immersed in the language of french (5). At 11 she moved to Miami, Florida where her family is based and attended middle school and high school, but at 16 returned back to Switzerland to do the International Baccalaureate Program. She now lives in Massachusetts where she is a sophomore at Wellesley College (3)(4). She is a multilingual speaker of 5 languages; Spanish, English, French, Russian and Modern Greek. She considers herself a native speaker of Spanish (7) since it was the language spoken at home, however she feels fluent in other languages (6). She considers English her “academic” language. French is a language she learned whilst in a private elementary school when she was young because her classes were taught in French (9). Although she doesn’t use it as often as Spanish and English, she says “at first I thought I’d lose fluency in French but once I begin to speak it, it flows.” (8) Being bilingual myself, I am constantly amazed by the emotions evoked with the languages I speak. There is a certain demeanor in which I perceive social situations depending on the language I’m speaking. When I first met Mariela in high school in Switzerland, I was amazed by the numerous languages she spoke at ease. In our three years of friendship we have spoken in French and English with each other. And based on the language, there is a shift in the tone and premise based on the language we speak with one another. Although our dialogue was similar in both languages, the demeanor in which we expressed ourselves changes the tone of our conversations. In my interview with Mariela, she said something that I felt compelled to analyze, “a door will always be a door despite whatever language you call door”. In my essay, I will analyze how and why multilingual people place specific emotions in certain languages. To achieve that, I’ll ask myself a question based on her analogy; “is it true that a door will remain the same door in every language?” 2 of 5 Growing up in a bilingual household gave Mariela the fundamental tools to expand her repertoire of learning languages. From learning French from living in Switzerland and currently studying Russian at Wellesley College, she continues to exercise her natural gift of languages and has now begun to tie certain emotions to specific languages. When asking Mariela the reason why she learned certain languages she said it was “not her choice” to learn languages (10). From Spanish spoken at home to English and French used in schools, it was inevitable she learned those languages. These languages are also used differently in social situations. For example, at home Spanish is spoken and she describes English as her “academic” language and fluency in French was “as a result of going to a private school in Switzerland” at a young age (11). The question of what language she thinks in was a tricky question for her to answer since these three languages seemed to be of equal caliber. However she revealed that she doesn’t quite pay attention to it but she said she thinks predominantly in either Spanish or English (12). “Due to the fact I’m in college, I’m constantly immersed in English”, she told me, and hence why she finds herself thinking in English. However she revealed that there are some situations in which she finds herself thinking in Spanish such as making a list of things to do, expressing herself and saying exclamatory sentences. From her exposure to Spanish at home, the language affiliates to certain activities as domestic chores and responsibilities which she isn’t exposed to in the other languages. Hence, she reveals she is only able to associate certain things when speaking Spanish. To explore the difference in emotions each language evokes in the subconscious mind of a person who is multilingual, it is always fascinating to know whether they dream in one language or in various languages. In Mariela’s case although she doesn’t quite remember all of her dreams, she dreams in Spanish, English and French (15). She shared a story of a time when she was younger and her mother heard someone speaking French in their apartment. None of her parents speak French, her mother was afraid someone was in the house but in reality it was Mariela sleep talking in French. Because Mariela grew up in Miami in a household where both parents speak Spanish and English, “Spanglish” was spoken while growing up (17). She described that when she was too lazy to think of a word in Spanish she’d say the word in English 3 of 5 or to create emphasis on a particular word. When asked about “Franglais” which is a blend of French and English, she revealed she never uses it because she has neither heard it nor interacted with people who speak it. This is an evident way in which she specifies certain emotions to different languages. Mariela uses the intertwining of the two languages to draw feeling she is unable to convey in simply one language. The use of an English word in the middle of a Spanish detracts from the “hominess” of the language and adds in a hint of the staleness she describes English as. According to Mariela, multilingualism is “the product of where I lived and how my parents decided to raise me” (18). She also says that by learning numerous languages it has allowed her to “perceive the world in various ways”. Despite having to learn Spanish and English by default and “forcefully” learning French, by her “fairytale perspective” it has expanded her perception of living in society. From these various languages including Russian, she describes that the way in which she categorizes words and emotions differ depending on the language. It is in this question where she stated that “a door will always be a door, however the category of the door is different based on the language spoken”. I then proceeded to ask her if she attaches certain emotions to certain languages and her answer was very intriguing (23). From speaking Spanish at home, she associates Spanish with care, love, and family. When referring to relatives, children, etc she uses the Spanish term for it. Hence, she revealed she expresses more empathic emotions using Spanish. English on the other hand, she describes as plain. Because it is her academic language, she finds it difficult to derive sympathetic feelings when speaking it. This is similar to French in which she describes as having “no attachment”. From the foundation of how she learned French and felt “thrown into the system where she was forced to speak it” , she derived a sense of apathy when speaking and finds it extremely difficult to attach empathy to her words. The part which I found very interesting were her emotions when speaking Russian. Despite the fact that she is not (yet) fluent in Russian, she revealed that she feels the sense of love when speaking it. This is interesting because this is a language that she began to learn just over a year ago but has derived the emotion of love which is only apparent in her Spanish dialogue. Despite her fluency and her ability to create words to form the same sentence in 4 of 5 multiple languages, there is a difference in the emotions attached to the language, and these differences exists due to the circumstances in which these languages were originally presented in Mariela’s life. Hence, the word may be the same, but the emotion evoked by the word differs per language. The social situations she had to face have proven to be the harbinger of either empathy or apathy she attaches to languages. In the life of a multilingual person, the placement of emotions in each language is heavily influenced by experiences of how they began to learn each language. In Mariela’s case, it is clear to say that the languages in which she was willing to learn out of her love and desire for them have more meaning to her than languages she described as being “forced” to learn due to life circumstances. Thus, she has separated emotions according to the languages she feels each emotion the most. In a perfect world, the door will always remain a door no matter what language you call door. But in reality, there’s so much more that goes beyond the capability of simply stating ‘door’. The door will always be different.

Linh Nguyen Linguistics 101 Professor Lillehaugen Bilingualism Interview Bilingualism Interview with Nancy Languages that speaks to one’s personalities, profession and happiness. The is my interview with Nancy*, who wishes to remain anonymous in the report. Nancy is a current 22-year-old college student. Nancy was born and raised in Vietnam until her 9th grade. Nancy then started her boarding school in the U.S following by 4 years of college here. (Question 1, 2, 3) During her time in boarding school and college, Nancy studies Chinese as her foreign languages to fulfill the languages requirements; thus English is somehow a “home language” or a “default language”, as she told me, to her although she nevers thinks of herself as an English native speaker. Vietnamese, on the other hand, is Nancy her identity and root with her family. (Question 4) . Besides, Nancy has been intensively studying French for almost 6 years to prepare for her graduate program in France after Bryn Mawr. Vietnamese is her definition of family language. Whenever she communicates with her family, whether it’s calling home on a weekly basis or all day long during school breaks, she always speaks Vietnamese. (Question 7, 9) Hearing people speaking Vietnamese whenever she returns to her hometown Ho Chi Minh City (a major city in Vietnam) makes her feel very peaceful, naturally and comfortable. “Do you know that feeling when you don’t have to focus to understand what’s going in life? And when you go to a local market and appreciate the crazy chaos and noise from people’s conversations there ? That’s my definition home language.” - said Nancy. She explains to me how she feels totally relaxing and comfortable in the middle of a crowd full of Vietnamese speakers as she knows that she’s at home. At that moment, I reflect back on my own happiness when I hear all the noise on the street food tour in my hometown. I came to realize that languages does not only show on one’s root and background but also connect with their emotion and happiness - the types of abstract feelings that could not be easily described in words. Speaking Vietnamese allows her to appreciate the oriental culture, one of which is to show respect to one’s grandparents or parents. For example, in Vietnamese, she will need to add “ạ", “Dạ", “vâng” either at the end or the beginning of her sentence to show her respect to the elderly. (Question 21) W henever she talks with her parents, Nancy mentions that she never mixes or drops an English word. She also considers it as a way to respect her Vietnamese language heritage and her family also expects her to treat the Viet language in the similar way. On the other hand, English is attached with her aspect of life in terms of friends, academics and professions work. As Nancy started learned English at the age of 5, and then has used English mostly during her 8 years in the States, Nancy considers English as her dominant language. (Question 7) Nancy uses English to communicate with her U.S friends, her professors and her colleagues at internship all day long for the past 8 years. Thus, whenever a problem comes up in an academic, professional or even relationship settings, Nancy uses English to thinks of the problem. More especially when she gets emotional, English will be the language that comes to her mind. Growing up as a teenager in the States, Nancy identifies herself with the American culture including music, movies and lifestyle but not food. She’s still very much in love with Vietnamese food and thinks Vietnamese food is the best. When we tried explaining this point, we believed that languages could easily influences one’s thinking process and perception of the world (linguistics relativism) but not one’s way of tasting or smelling or other tangible forms of perception. Nancy also thinks that the bilingual experience has so far given her a lot of advantages and great opportunities. It’s easier for her to communicate and to sympathize with people from different cultures. She could easily relate her experience in languages and culture to any new friends that she make. (Question 18). Nancy considers French as the language of her career. As a lot of well-known pharmaceutical program are taught at France, Nancy has been studying French intensively for years to prepare for her next move. She does not only study how to use French in daily conversations but also studies the vocabulary that she might need to use for her expertise studying and career later. “It’s funny when people think of French as a language of culture, poems and arts, I think of French as something very serious. To me, French means biochemistry, labs, medicine name and pharmaceutical grad program.” - Nancy told me. The main reason is that most of her exposure and intention for French is to serve her grad program later, so she does not have a lot of emotion attached to the language. She considers it as a part of the skill shown in an application. “But it does excite me a little bit if I think of it as my future.” - Nancy explains. That line keeps me wondering if languages could be think of as one’s lifetime. As in Nancy’s case, Viet language has always been her childhood when English attaches to her teenage time and French will be her language of culture. But one could also argue that Vietnamese is her identity of home when English shows her personalities and French is an important part of her profession. Both ways sounds right to Nancy’s experience. Moreover, Nancy never experiences a hard time switch between her two “modes” or identity between these two. This point stands out to me as I’ve seen a lot of people with bilingual experience struggling with their identities. Nancy, on the contrary, speaks highly positive of her multilingual experience. “Knowing one more language means knowing one more culture and will lead you to the amazing opportunities you’ll never know.” Her final word on the interview concludes my thoughts on her experience with multilingualism as it truly reflects her experience over the past 22 years.

Bilingual Interview
Abstract: Cii is a 21-year-old bilingual speaker of Vietnamese and English [1][2] [4]. She was born and grew up in Vietnam, and started learning English at grade 6 [3] [5]. Now that she is a junior at Bryn Mawr, she has mastered both spoken and written English, and uses the language on a daily basis. [5][6][7] She only uses Vietnamese when she speaks to her Vietnamese friends on campus or when she Skypes with her parents who are still living in Vietnam [8] [9]. The interview reflected Cii’s thoughts and feelings as a bilingual, with a focus on how English has an impact on her communication style and personality.
“To have another language is to possess a second soul” – Charlemagne must have realized the importance of language beyond a mere tool of communication when he exclaimed these words. His saying happens to sum up all of my feelings after I listened to Cii sharing her thought on being bilingual. As we have been friends for the last three years, Cii has never failed to impress me with her observing mind and contemplative nature. In this interview, Cii once again surprised me. A bilingual myself, I always appreciate how it enables me to broaden my horizons and live a more fulfilling life. Nonetheless, little did I realize that speaking a second language could allow one to understand more about oneself as Cii did.
Cii was born and grew up in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. Like many parents in this globalizing city, Cii’s parents encouraged her to learn English at a pretty young age, around 10 as far as she can remember. But Cii only mastered the language after three years living at Bryn Mawr. Now, as a dominant language in Cii’s daily life, English has become vital for her to communicate herself fully. For instance, Cii often relies on English when she wants to express her anger, surprise or disappointment as she finds the equivalent terms and phrases in Vietnamese to be much less expressive [16]. Moreover, Cii feels that English helps her to express exactly how she feels or what she thinks of a matter in a concise manner. “Like”, said Cii, “if I want to show that I have a mixed idea about something or someone, I can just say I’m ambivalent! But in Vietnamese, it would take the lengthy Toi chang ghet ma cung chang thich or Toi cung khong biet ro nua!” As she is speaking English on a daily basis now, Cii has come to appreciate how English motivates her to be more flexible in her communication. “There are many ways to express my feelings. I can say I’m tired or Today has been a long day!”. Cii notices the similar flexibility in her native language, but wishes that it could be practiced as frequently as in English. 
Given what she said on the pros of having English as a second language, it does no wonder to me to hear that her Vietnamese is no longer “pure” as it used to be. Cii admits to having mixed English words in her conversation with Vietnamese more and more often ever since she came to study here [17]. Yet, she only mixes the two languages when she speaks with her friends and her sister who is also living in the US. She remains very considerate when talking to her parents and elderly people, emphasizing that she always has to speak proper Vietnamese to them. 
Like many international students on campus who mastered English later in life, Cii thinks faster in her native language than in English [14]. Even though she is a fluent English speaker now, it always takes her a longer time to process information and response in English. As a result, she appears as a little bit shy to native English speakers while to her Vietnamese friends, she is very sociable, talkative and quick-witted. As I demonstrated my concern over this misrepresentation of her, Cii just laughed it off and regarded it as hardly a problem. Cii firmly believes that native speakers will understand that she needs time to pick up a new language and fit in a new culture. More importantly, she wants to enjoy the “process”: that is seeing herself get better every day.
Speaking a new language on a daily basis allows Cii to develop an “alternate version of self”. She has learnt to be more detailed and descriptive in conversations and she gets quicker in finding specific examples to support her arguments. Furthermore, Cii realizes that she becomes more animated when she talks in English than in Vietnamese. She acquires a higher-pitched voice and finds herself naturally having more facial expressions while speaking in English [23]. Being bilingual also makes Chi aware of some English phrases that she never says in Vietnamese. For instance, she says “How are you doing?” a lot in a day, to both her friends and acquaintances on campus. Yet, she rarely uses the equivalent term in Vietnamese, given that it is only meant for old friends who catch up with one another once in a while. The Vietnamese term, according to Cii, is likely to arouse a “distanced” and non-intimate feeling. I am very interested in her thinking, since I noticed the same in my high school Vietnamese friends. When I said “How are you doing?” to them at one of our gatherings this summer, most were too surprised to react. Perhaps I was affected by the American culture and considered this saying as a normal opening for a casual catch-up, but my friends thought differently and turned totally uncomfortable the moment they heard it. Some even joked back at me “High school is not too long ago!”, which I did not find funny in the least.
It is likely to be an impact of the American culture with which Cii’s English is associated, but Cii often gets more concise and to the point when she speaks in English. This actually gives her lots of comfort when she talks to her English-speaking friends, since she does not need to figure out “tactful” ways to express herself as in Vietnamese.  In addition, Cii embraces that talking English to friends usually gets her to go into details and think more logically. For example, if a Vietnamese asks Cii about her day and she responds that it is OK, the conversation usually ends here or moves on to a different subject. But her American friends tend to be curious about what has happened to her and ask follow up questions, which gradually makes her comfortable with talking about herself. Besides, Cii has been encouraged her to think hard and raise her voices in discussion-based classes at Bryn Mawr, an experience that she never got back home. Based on her interactions with friends and in class, Cii now thinks that she can have more open and meaningful conversations when she speaks in English.
Cii’s family has always supported her to be bilingual, and Cii herself believes that knowing several languages is a blessing [25]. It opens the door to new knowledge and perspectives, and as a person who loves to learn, Cii thinks that being bilingual, even multilingual, is crucial. Still, Cii admits that speaking both English and Vietnamese has caused her some troubles. Sometimes, she feels sorry that she inserts more and more English words subconsciously when she means to speak in Vietnamese. Cii reflected on her dependence on English, regretting that she could spend more time and efforts on bettering her Vietnamese command. Cii is afraid that mixing the two languages may become a bigger issue in the future as she wants to go back and work in Vietnam. Moreover, being bilingual can put Cii into a dilemma regarding cultural identity. For instance, being Vietnamese, Cii was not offended if someone she met once or twice forgot her name, which consequently made her feel comfortable to ask people’s names if she did not remember them. However, arriving at Bryn Mawr, she realized that Americans tend to be more sensitive when it comes to names, and that she had to be careful when asking them for names that she has forgotten. Over time, she now thinks that asking people’ names bluntly is quite rude, and she can take an offense when some Vietnamese does not try to find a tactful way to re-ask her name. On a second thought, she does not know if she should feel that way or not [26].
Another situation that makes Cii realize how conflicted she is with regard to cultural identity happened in one of her class. During his presentation on an architectural design, Cii’s classmate suddenly exclaimed that the building in fact looked like a penis! Cii laughed just like the rest of the class, for that saying was not only funny but also unexpected. But deep inside, Cii knew that she would never laugh if someone says the same thing in Vietnamese. If someone says “penis” in Vietnamese, she would consider it very rude no matter the context. She felt that she could judge a person when he/she says the Vietnamese word for penis.
Listen to Cii over an hour left me with a refreshing mind on the influence of bilingualism. Cii was born and grew up in a very conservative family where her parents emphasized on her speaking a standard Vietnamese, and shaped her ideas of communication etiquettes. But as Cii learnt English and later spoke the language on a daily basis with friends here, she was granted more freedom in the way she expresses herself. For Cii, English has become more than just an academic languages or a tool to socialize with foreigners. It makes Cii aware of the unknown personalities in her; ones that are more “flexible, open-minded and less judging” – as she would say. More importantly, it serves as a key to the American culture which is affecting Cii’s thinking and perspective every day. To end my interview, I asked Cii if she wanted to raise her children as bilinguals or not. Cii nodded in agreement immediately, but insisted that her children should be great conversationalists in Vietnamese first and should always speak with her in their mother tongues. I have no doubt over what she plans for her children. 

The Practical Speaker: An Interview

The Practical Speaker: An Interview 
Stephanie Tseng (1), age 18 (2), was born in Taiwan but raised in Vietnam (3), where she learned Chinese from her parents, Vietnamese from her surroundings, and English from her school (4). She considers English to be her dominant language, followed by Chinese, then Vietnamese (6,7). She usually speaks Chinese at home (9). She is currently a first-year at Bryn Mawr College (3). 
Stephanie speaks English well enough that when I (an American) first met her, I was surprised to learn that she was an international student (6). She was born in Taiwan, “which is a province of China, except no-one agrees if it’s actually part of China.” She grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where she attended a private school that taught in English (12) – many of her teachers were American, she notes. Therefore Stephanie considers English to be her dominant language: it “comes most naturally” to her, it’s the one she speaks most often (8), and it’s the one in which she has the most advanced vocabulary (7). Her phone settings are in English, too, and she gets most of her entertainment from American media. In Vietnam, she says, movie theaters are cheap, and so she watched movies almost every weekend. She is very current on Hollywood blockbusters, she notes with some pride. Although most of her entertainment diet is in English, she does watch Taiwanese television “sometimes” (13). Stephanie was exposed to English a lot during her life, and therefore she speaks it very well.
Although she is not as confident in Chinese as she is in English, she says that native Chinese speakers tend to see her as native, too – “other than the fact that I don’t use slang or swear, which they might find a bit strange,” (24). If she’s going to swear, she does it in English (16). “About the worst I know how to say in Chinese is ‘Why are you so stupid?’” For her, Chinese is “the language at home,” or what she speaks to her parents and relatives (9, 12). Stephanie is aware that her Chinese is lacking, and so she will “supplement” it with English, “making up for [her] lack of vocabulary.” The opposite, she says, has only ever happened once: “I’ve slipped up and spoken Chinese instead of English, but that was with one of my friends who could actually understand what I was talking about, in both languages…So she got it anyway,” (17). One noticeable difference in how she speaks across languages is tone of voice: “In English,” she says, “I am most confident, and I will speak in the lowest register, and it goes up [as I get less confident],” (23). She also finds herself acting differently when speaking Chinese. In Asian culture, she says, “They have different expectations of women. You’re kind of expected to be this quiet, shy little girl,” (20). To demonstrate, she gives me a demure, doe-eyed look and her voice drops in volume while raising in pitch. Consequently, Stephanie finds herself changing to conform to these expectations (23), which shows her different relationship with each language. It seems that in the language that represents her heritage, she feels more bound by tradition.
Of all her languages, Stephanie is least confident in her Vietnamese. This language, she says, is “more like an adopted skill.” She spoke it as part of daily life in Vietnam, especially with her nanny, who watched over her while her parents worked (12). She did not speak it with her friends, her parents, or her teachers. She compares her proficiency to that of a five-year-old (6). “I can’t really speak…intellectually about subjects in that language…. I don’t know any scientific terms for example.” Vietnamese people, she says, can immediately tell that she is not a native speaker (24). “They basically just think, ‘Oh! This cute foreign girl can speak a bit of our language.’” Sometimes, if she knows they will understand, Stephanie will reply to a Vietnamese speaker in English (17). Despite the fact that she does not speak the language all that well, Stephanie still considers Vietnam her home. “I lived there since I was two months old…short of being born there, I’m basically Vietnamese.” To her, there is not a one-to-one connection between language and cultural identity. She pointed out that many self-described Latino/a people don’t speak Spanish. 
When I asked her if she had ever been treated differently for being multilingual, she gave me a blank look (27). “Not that I know of?” Stephanie treats her multilingualism in a very matter-of-fact way: when asked what it means to her, she laughs and says, “It just means that I have to understand a lot more conversations than I would otherwise,” (18). However, she would like her future children to be multilingual, saying, “It’s definitely a way to connect to different cultures that’s not afforded to people who are monolingual” (28). When pressed further, she reveals that her relatives think her multilingualism is “something…to capitalize on,” which she seems to agree with (25). “When applying for jobs and internships, being able to speak multiple languages is definitely a leg up.” Perhaps this practical approach stems from the fact that her life has always been lived in multiple languages. Growing up trilingual was never a “conscious decision,” she states (10). “My mom actually told me that I started speaking really late, because there were too many languages coming to me at once, and so when I started actually speaking I could speak all three, more or less. It wasn’t really a process of one after the other” (5). She refers to her acquisition of language as an “assimilation” of all the different languages in her environment. To Stephanie, multilingualism is not an astonishing thing, it’s just how she is.
	I didn’t find what I expected in this interview. There was no angst about not fitting in, no soulful harping about how language was a way to connect to her ancestral culture. Stephanie was raised in a privileged community where everyone was multilingual. It was easy to stay in touch with her heritage. She was a mix of identities, and she seemed at peace with that. To Stephanie, her languages are just how she communicates. Oh, and they make for useful resumé glitter.

Sasha Rogelberg Rogelberg LING.B101 Introduction to Linguistics Lillehaugen 16 November 2017 1 A good cry in Kannada: A conversation with Janaki Gooty Janaki Gooty (1), 41 (2), was born in Kurnool, India, grew up in Hyderabad, India, before moving to the United States and eventually Charlotte, NC (3) where she lives now. Janaki learned to speak Kannada in her home, but attended an English school growing up, where she received instruction in English and learned to speak, write, and read fluently in this language, which became her dominant one (4, 5, 6, & 7). In this English school, Janaki learned to read, speak, and write Hindi, India’s national language; and she also learned to speak Telugu, which is the language spoken in her state (4, 5, 6, & 7). Today, Janaki, a professor in business, uses primarily English, but also speaks to her family in Kannada when they visit one another, the language she grew up with in her home (8, 9). Over the summer, my friend Janaki Gooty’s (Question 1) family came to visit for Janaki’s niece’s first birthday party. Usually Janaki, 41 (2), travels to Bangkok, Thailand to visit her sister and extended family, while her mom comes to visit her in Charlotte, North Carolina (3) and stays with her for a few months. This year, Janaki was in the process of building her new house, so her entire family came to visit her for a few weeks, while her mother continued to stay in Charlotte through September. During the birthday party for Janaki’s niece Smera, Janaki came over to me and explained that just in the living room of her home, Janaki’s sister’s husband was speaking to his mother in Marathi, Janaki’s friends from Charlotte were speaking to each other in Gujarati, and so was Janaki’s sister’s mother-in law; Janaki’s mother was speaking in Kannada with her cousins, her sister and her sister-in-law were speaking Hindi, while Janaki spoke her sister in Kannada. Janaki told me this in English. Though many languages were being spoken in her home the afternoon of Smera’s party, Janaki could only speak and understand about half of them. Janaki was born in Kurnool, India but grew up in Hyderabad near Bangalore, until moving to the United States after university and eventually moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where she is a professor of business at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (3). Janaki has spoken English, Hindi, Telugu, and Kannada—a Dravidian language spoken in Southern India that’s related to Tamil--since she was a child (4,5). Kannada was the language spoken inside of her home, so Janaki considers herself completely fluent in speaking Kannada, but not in writing or reading it, as it was primarily spoken to her. It is also the language that her family put the most pressure on her to learn and maintain; of all of the languages Janaki knows, Kannada is spoken among the fewest people. Because Janaki was raised in a Roman Catholic school system where the nuns spoke English, her Rogelberg 2 father told Janaki to speak Kannada at home in order to make sure she maintained her knowledge and use of it, even though he himself had trouble speaking the language. Janaki’s mother refused to speak to Janaki unless she would respond in Kannada, and Kannada remains the language she and her mother interact in. Because of the British colonization of India, even in its southern parts, Janaki spoke and learned English at school. “Even during our Hindi class, things would be explained to us in English.” Janaki learned Hindi and Telugu because of where she lived. Hindi is the national language of India, so it was taught in school and Janaki can read Hindi fluently in addition to speaking it. Telugu, however, is spoken regionally and is her state language, so Janaki never learned to read it fluently, only speak it (10). This is the language that has atrophied the most for Janaki (6, 11). Though she considers English her second language, Janaki uses English the most and considers it her thinking language. She uses it at work, with all non-Indian friends, and when she reads and writes (7, 13). Hindi and Telugu have the mot specific contexts in which they are used—only when Janaki returns home to Hyderabad or travels around India does she use these languages (12). However, in Hyderabad, Janaki’s friends and family will often make fun of her atrophied Telugu, but Janaki didn’t seem to have a problem with her atrophied language (25). It is the language she uses in the most specific context—only when she is visiting Hyderabad—so it does not have the same practical or sentimental purposes as her other three languages. Janaki has no problems switching between Kannada and English. While Janaki will dream in both English and Kannada, the dreams in Kannada will be exclusively about her family, while her English dreams will be about anything else (15). The use of these languages are context dependent and because of this, Janaki can usually keep them separate, but there are a few exceptions. Janaki says that there are occasions where she’ll talk to her mother or sister on the phone at work and before she walks into her class to teach, she has to think for a moment before switching to English to teach her class. These languages are also mixed when Janaki texts her mother. They will both use the Greek alphabet to spell out Kannada words phonetically (17). Just as Kannada and English serve distinctive practical purposes in Janaki’s life, they also serve different emotional purposes. When Janaki feels positive emotions, she says she feels them in English (22). However, negative emotions are experienced in Kannada. “When I cry, I cry in Kannada,” says Janaki. When Janaki cries in English, “it’s never as fulfilling as in Kannada”. When she needs a good cry, she will cry in Kannada. Janaki says that this is because Rogelberg 3 crying is more primal than any other emotional experience (22). She is returning to her most basic and child-like form, and because Kannada was most dominant during her childhood, that is the language to which she returns. At this point in the conversation, Janaki and I got sidetracked, and she told me about her plans to adopt a dog after her trip over her fall break, so I asked her about what language she would speak to her dog in. At first, she said English, and then Kannada, and then both, insisting that she would have a bilingual dog that would respond to both Kannada and English (28). There are certainly parallels in what language you feel in at your most vulnerable and what language in which you communicate with your pets. Janaki felt the same way about her dog’s language abilities as her potential partner and child’s. She doesn’t expect her partner to already know Kannada, but she insisted that he must be able to learn (28). Kannada holds so much importance in Janaki’s life that it is the language in which she speaks to her niece Smera. This is especially important to Janaki because Smera is growing up exposed to so many different languages: Smera has already been exposed to Thai, Hindi, Gujarati, and English. Janaki wants Smera to eventually learn a non-Asian language, however, such a French (28). Janaki shares this sentiment for herself and wants to be able to learn Italian or Spanish (29). Living in America, Janaki believes everyone should learn to speak Spanish, but her desire to learn Italian and for Smera to learn French comes from her desire to be able to travel. I knew Janaki spoke multiple languages, but when I asked her if she considered herself multilingual, she said she “[didn’t] speak a single foreign language” because she never put effort into learning another language, they were all go inherent to her development and upbringing. When I first asked Janaki if she wanted to participate in this project for our linguistics class, Janaki had to think for a moment. English had become so much a part of her, that she thought initially that she only spoke English. However, regardless of how she labels herself in relation to the languages she knows, Janaki insists that it’s not knowing a certain language that allows her to perceive the word in the most meaningful way, but rather that she knows so many (18). In English, she has complete control over reading, writing, and speaking and it is the language on which her career depends, yet it is her knowledge of Kannada that allows her to communicate best with her family and experience her most fundamental emotions, while Telugu and Hindi allow her to travel and communicate with others when she returns home to Hyderabad (12). Rogelberg 4 However, the combination of all these languages that give Janaki access to all components of her life ensure that her “communication is richer” and her “expressions are fuller” (26). Janaki’s experiences with English and Kannada in particular illustrate that fluency of a language and that language’s meaning in someone’s life do not have a 1:1 correlation with one another. For Janaki, English is the language she uses the most and the language she has had the most formal education in, yet Kannada, a language she does not know the alphabet for and speaks in family-oriented contexts, remains the language dearest her her heart and the language she puts the greatest emphasis on maintaining and passing down to younger generations. While language and culture are not synonymous, Janaki’s profound value of Kannada speaks to a desire to preserve parts of her past and her heritage. Through speaking to her niece in Kannada, Janaki aims to keep the language in her family, and by expressing and feeling sadness and hurt in Kannada, Janaki hopes to preserve and express her most personal, visceral, and fundamental emotional states. While we think about the purpose languages serve in our lives, we must recognize that a language the most spoken or the most learned is not the one that is always most reflective of the values of and insight into a person. Janaki’s cries in Kannada demonstrate this.

The Three F’s
Victoria, a 21-year-old fourth year student, was born and raised in tightly-knit Portuguese community in New Jersey (1, 2, 3). She considers herself very fluent in three languages: Portuguese, English, and Spanish (4, 6). Portuguese is language that she learned from her birth, which she uses as a way to communicate with her parents, family, and friends from her hometown (5, 8, 9). Though Victoria never spoke English until second grade at her primary school, it is now her dominant language (7). She learned Spanish in high school and college as a means of translating for the people in her community (5, 6). Victoria’s multilingual experience demonstrates the communion of language exhibited through her upbringing and culture.
--
Returning to campus after being abroad, I was pleasantly surprised that my roommate was Victoria (1), an incredibly genial and easygoing 21-year-old student (2). At the time, all I knew about her was that she is majoring in chemistry, and she lives in New Jersey (3). We never spoke much before then, so I made it my mission to know more about my new roommate. With time, we grew more comfortable with one another, sharing stories back and forth about our lives back home. On the day of our interview, she plops on to the couch in the living room, and takes a breath. “Okay,” she starts sheepishly, “back home, they have this thing called the ‘three F’s’. It is really stupid, but everyone follows it back home”. Sitting at the edge of her seat now, Victoria continued, “So, the three F’s: Futebol, Fatima, Foclorico. Futebol is our ingrained love for soccer. Fatima is the Portuguese Virgin Mary, which shows our faith. Foclorico is our traditional dance. This reinforces our nationalism and pride.” In her hometown, playing soccer, going to church, and dancing culturally reinforced her strong sense of community to this day. This initial insight into Victoria’s language experience demonstrates the community of language exhibited through her upbringing and culture.
Parents or guardians can largely dictate a person’s language and culture, and this is reflected in Victoria’s experience as well. At a very young age, Victoria’s parents emigrated from Portugal to find better economic opportunities abroad as many people did in that time. With furrowed brows, Victoria started shaking her in remembering the tumultuous history of Portugal. “There was a definite struggle in Portugal. Yet, getting accustomed to life in the United States is an incredibly difficult task. There are different customs and norms that are all so unfamiliar. So, if you had any connections whatsoever, you took advantage of that.” This frame of thought led to the founding a cultural enclave in New Jersey composed of Portuguese compatriots. This is the culture in which Victoria was raised: a community built on struggles, but hell-bent on succeeding. Thus, as a child, her use of Portuguese had been crucial for socialization, and it also provided a link to the only community she could relate to at the time (4, 5, 10). With a casual shrug, Victoria explained that language is simply a means of communicating with her parents, her siblings, her friends, and everyone in her community (10, 12). Thus, maintaining her place in this interdependent community then became a strong motivation behind learning Portuguese.
Even though she was born and raised in the United States, Victoria only started to learn English in the second grade (4, 5). “This was a normal occurrence for the children of Portuguese immigrants. We were all in the English as a Second Language class! Luckily, many of the teachers were fluent in both Portuguese and English. As a result, we were able to understand most of our classes. So, the transition into learning English was pretty easy” (10). She even took attended Portuguese school in the evenings from 2nd to 7th grade to learn more about her Portuguese language and culture. Nevertheless, English continues to be exclusively used throughout her experience in academic institutions (12). Pouting, Victoria laments, “After going away to college, I barely ever talk Portuguese anymore. The extent of my use of Portuguese is contained in the conversations with my parents. I do not have the same vocabulary usage in Portuguese. As a chemistry major, I do not know the Portuguese word for ‘chirality’, and I don’t think I will ever need that translated in Portuguese. To be honest, even if I had the words to explain the meaning of ‘chirality’ in Portuguese, I could only explain it to my family, and they would probably die of boredom” (11). Victoria confirms that English is currently her dominant language (7). On a day to day basis, Victoria is often exposed to English, from her academic to her media consumption. However, as a fanatic of the Portugal National Football team, Victoria made it very clear to me that all games about soccer are seen and read in Portuguese as its quality is far superior. While her knowledge of Portuguese is vital to her cultural identity, English grew to be the predominate language for academia and her life in general (12).
We then spoke about her experience learning Spanish as a foreign language in high school. Slumping back on the couch, Victoria let out a cheeky laugh remembering her high school experience. “We only had three choices for language classes: Portuguese, French, and Spanish. I wanted to take Portuguese for the obvious reasons. French was different. Yet, nothing fit into my schedule other than Spanish. In the end, Spanish became incredibly beneficial for me” (10). Since high school, Victoria knew she wanted to work as a medical professional with direct patient care. Working in local hospital, she realized the need of translators for the minority Portuguese and Hispanic population as many do not speak English (12). Victoria said animatedly, “I wasn’t sure if I could help out. Hospitals are overwhelmed with many patients, and the staff is constantly stretched thin. You know, you don’t want to step on anyone’s toes. Yet, I was encouraged by the nursing staff to help out! Though it was hard to hear about the troubles of the patients, it was gratifying that I was able to translate information to expedite their care” (25). This experience made her realize the value of being a multilingual, especially in a hospital serving a diverse community (26).
When I asked her about her general experience with language, her answer often circled back to the language of her upbringing: Portuguese, the language that is involved in so many aspects of her life back home (20). “I definitely think and behave differently in Portuguese. When I am with my Portuguese community in Jersey, I am much more outspoken and comfortable” (22, 23). However, whenever she goes back to her family’s native country, her family does not regard her as completely fluent because it appears that she and her parents are entirely Americanized (24). Giving another shrug, Victoria does not let these perceptions really affect her at all because she understands that her language experience is unique compared to her family born and raised in Portugal.  
Now more than ever, there is a lot of stress and judgement coming from older generation to maintain the language in younger generations. Victoria says, “People from my parent’s generation were among the first to come to the United States from Portugal. Eventually, they bought over their families, and created this strong community. Now, the second and third generations born in the United States are beginning to lose their language because their parents know more English” (25). The goal of these older generations is to save the language, but the exposure of English is a definitely a strong influence from all types of media exposure. There a perception that these young children are more distanced from the culture and language, but Victoria doesn’t believe that it has hurt the community framework; rather, it makes the community stronger. This younger generation is creating a greater diversity of how Portuguese culture is currently portrayed. Beaming with a large smile, she states that even while it is undergoing a bit of changes, the values of the Portuguese culture is never left behind as a result of this community’s willingness to stay united. 
Her identity and personality is intricately intertwined with the Portuguese, English, and Spanish communities of languages. When I asked Victoria what it means to be multilingual to her, Victoria took an elongated pause for the first time throughout the interview in the attempt to find the best work to frame her multilingual experience. “To be multilingual is to exist in a community at certain times,” she paused again, “but it can also be existing in several communities at the same time” (18). All in all, it is about community. Language does not happen in isolation; rather, it is consisted of the interaction with people. Language is impossible without these social interactions. Victoria gratefully attributes her multilingualism and her identity as a result of her presence in these Portuguese, English, and Spanish communities. By the end of our interview, Victoria had a revelation: without these communities, she would not be the person she is today (19). Without any one of these communities, Victoria wouldn’t feel complete. Her identity stem from her interactions and involvements with all these communities. While each community proves different contexts and meanings to her, her knowledge of Portuguese, English and Spanish makes her feel whole when in these communities. 

Anita Wu Bilingualism Interview October 9th, 2017 Deconstructing Languages and Defying Expectations: An Interview with a Bilingual Poet When I found out about this assignment, I immediately thought of my friend Charlotte Xu(1). I first heard of her when one of the poems she had written got published in a national poetry magazine. Charlotte, age 20(2), was born and grew up in Shanghai, China. She moved to Philadelphia for college when she was 18 years old(3). Charlotte is a comparative literature and philosophy double major at Bryn Mawr College. She is a fluent speaker of three languages, Mandarin Chinese, English, and German. Mandarin Chinese is her native language; she started learning English when she was in kindergarten; she studied German for six years in middle school and high school(4,5). She feels like she speaks Mandarin Chinese and English equally fluently. Her German is not as good. It is more of like daily conversation level. She cannot understand complex sentences in German(6). She uses both English and Mandarin frequently now. She uses English more for academics since she studies in the United States. And Mandarin is used more to communicate with family members and Chinese friends(8). She writes in both English and Mandarin Chinese, but not in German(13). The question regarding the dominant language sent Charlotte on a rant: "Although I grew up in Shanghai, China. My parents raised me in a pretty western way. I was exposed to American TV series, American movies and western ideas from a pretty early age(elementary school). After I came to study in the United States, my identity really bothered me. I felt like I'm living on the border of China and America. I feel related to both countries. But I feel like I’m neither Chinese Wu 2 nor American. I’m kind of intertwined. I live in-between. I am between Chinese and American culture. And the two languages play a major role in my identity(7).” All these traces back to Charlotte’s first experiences of learning English. She recalled her early experiences with English: “I started learning English in kindergarten and I hated it back then. My dad told me that I used to skip English classes when I was five.” But things started to change when she was in elementary school. Her dad started to bring more western influences into the family. “He took me to his friend, who is an English professor at a famous university in Shanghai, to take private English lessons,” said Charlotte, “I started to like English ever since.” Her father also tried to make friends with native English speakers and asked them to practice speaking English with his young daughter. According to Charlotte, her father tried hard to make an “English-speaking environment” for her from an early age. It seems to me that how her parents, especially her father, raised her was a key factor to why she felt related to both western and Chinese cultures. Her parents don’t speak English though. She only speaks Mandarin with her parents at home(9). Charlotte described her experience as a writer. “I write in both Chinese and English,” said Charlotte. She scribbled down her emotions and thoughts into her diary. According to Charlotte, “Sometimes in my diaries, I write poems. They are just broken sentences in my diaries. Then I combine them and mode them into a poem.” She said that sometimes her diaries are a combination of both English and Chinese. When she writes sentimental things, fantasies, and love stories, she will write them in English. “Because that’s what I read in English. I learned all that stuff from the young adult novels. High school drama, young love, stuff like that,” she shrugged and laughed. She noted that when she writes in English, she expresses her emotions more. She provided an example of her having a crush on a girl last summer. She recalled, “I Wu 3 would recall how I felt at the moment and how we interacted with each other. The eyes, the hands, everything.” However, she also noted that when she was writing in Chinese, she would be more “critical.” She would question herself if those were real feelings and she judged her own feelings. “I think Chinese and English give you two different ways of thinking. For English, I tend to go with my feelings. I tend to express all I feel at the moment. But for Chinese, at least for me, it feels critical. I would doubt if that feeling actually exists. And I would be concerned about a lot of things(22).” The fact that she feels more comfortable expressing her emotions when she’s writing in English and that she analyzes her own thought when she writes in Mandarin Chinese fascinated me. She laughed and explained the difference to me, “I think that is something to do with the nature of the two languages. I think when you look at the language structures of the two languages, verbs and adjectives are more frequently used in English. But in Chinese, nouns are more used. Nouns are very fixed, regulated, ordered structure. Verbs are more flexible. They have this sense of flowing and changing. (11,12)” For Charlotte, the experience of writing in English as a non-native speaker has been a mixture of good and bad. She told me that the good thing is that she can experience multiple cultures and combine them. It’s “rich experience for a writer, which is very important.” But there are also challenges. “I think it’s definitely hard in the beginning. I think writing in every language is about practices. The more you practice and use the language, the better you get. It takes time.” She also shared a story that happened to her once with me. Charlotte is a member of the school swimming team. During her sophomore year, she took a creative writing class and once told her swimming coach how passionate she was about this class. Charlotte also told her that she wanted to stay at Bryn Mawr for the summer and finish a novel with her Creative Wu 4 Writing professor. And hopefully, she will be able to publish the book. Her coach’s response was interesting. She asked, “In English?”. This shows that her coach was making the assumption that non-native speakers of English are not supposed to write well in the language. Her coach knows that Charlotte’s first language is not English. “She made the assumption that it would be hard for non-native speakers to write in “perfect English,” which I totally understand.” Charlotte said, “I understand that this kind of ideology is unavoidable. The prejudice against non-native speakers is hard to get rid of. We need more non-native speakers to prove that we can write in second languages.” When being asked what it means to her to be a bilingual writer, Charlotte answered my question with one simple word: “deconstruction.”(18) When I asked her to explain what she meant by the word, she answered, “We should deconstruct the idea that we should meet the criteria to speak or write in ‘perfect’ language. We aren’t supposed to be expected to write the same things as the native speakers. The ideology that we need to fulfill certain standards and rules—the “pure” English. I think it’s nonsense.” She also believed that languages are never just languages. They are the embodiment of culture. Stereotypes are associated with languages and speaking or writing in “pure” or “real” language is one of them. According to Charlotte, it’s a “Euro-centric idea” that reflects the prejudices against foreigners. (26,27) As a sentimental person and a poet, Charlotte appreciates the significance of languages in her life. “I will continue writing in both languages. Writing means so much to me because I never thought I could write poetry. I want to prove that non-native writers can also write. I want to deconstruct languages and defy expectations though writing. I'm so ready to write, write, and write for my whole life.”
